\begin{abstract}

Music recommendation systems are increasingly important in the ever 
    growing world of digital music.  However, most commercial music 
    recommenders rely on collaborative filtering techniques to generate 
    music recommendations. These type of recommendations lack two aspects 
    that are important for recommendation.  First, they lack transparency 
    - they cannot explain why an item was recommended beyond the trivial 
    ``Other people who listened to XX also listened to YY". Second, they 
    lack steerability - there is no way for a user to interact with the 
    recommender to steer it to more relevant content.
    
    In this paper we show the Sun Labs Music Explaura - a 
    web-based recommender that provides transparent and steerable 
    recommendations. The Music Explaura can offer a detailed explanation 
    about why a particular item was recommended and will allow a user to 
    steer the recommendations based upon attributes of the music.

\section{The Aura}

In our system for recommending items, each musical artist is annotated
by a set of descriptive words and phrases.  The source
of words for an artist can be from text mining the web, from social
annotations, autotagging based upon content analysis, expert
annotation, etc.  One significant source of words in our current
implementation are the social tags from the social music website
Last.fm, mined using the Audioscrobbler web services\footnote{Last.fm's
Audioscrobbler web services described at
http://www.audioscrobbler.net/data/webservices/.}.

Some words such as \textit{rock} and \textit{alternative} are
commonly applied to many artist and therefore are not very descriptive,
while terms such as \textit{shoegaze} and \textit{grindcore} are
less frequently applied (and thus more discriminating).  To emphasize
words that are more descriptive, each term is weighted using the
standard text retrieval weighting function TF-ID\cite{tfidf}. This
weighting function gives more weight to words that occur more
frequently for a particular item when compared to the frequency of
the word across all items.  The set of weighted tags for an item
is called an item's ``tag cloud'' or in a more poetic way, it's
\textit{aura}.  We use this ``tag cloud'' as a representation of
an artist in our system. The distance between two artists is merely
the cosine distance between the two tag clouds\cite{cosine}.



\section{Transparency}
One important key to the success  of a music recommender is to gain the
trust of its users\cite{trust}.  One way to gain this trust is to provide
detailed explanations of why an item was recommended.  However,
most commercial music recommenders rely on collaborative filtering
techniques to offer recommendations.  These systems cannot offer
any more detailed explanation of why an item was recommended beyond
the simplistic "people who liked artist X, also liked artist Y".
These opaque recommmendations do little to engender trust.

Since our recommendations are based upon the similarity between  the tag clouds
of a preferred item and the recommended item, we can
offer a more detailed explanation of why an item was recommended
by showing how the two tag clouds overlap. \ref{fig:commontags} shows
the overlapping tags for the artists \textit{Radiohead} and \textit{Muse}.
Only words common to the two artists are displayed. The size of the
font is determined by the weight and the tags and the strength of the
overlap.

explanation of why Muse is recommended to a Radiohead listener. The tags in the 
clouds are weighted by the strength of the overlap between the two clouds.}

\section{Steerability}
\begin{figure*}

\caption{The steerable recommendations interface. Users are able to add tags or artists to the cloud by clicking on them from the right hand panel. Then, they can click and drag them to modify their size. A tag that is shrunk below the size of zero will begin to grow again as a negative tag and act as a filter in the returned recommendations.}
\label{fig:steerable}
\end{figure*}

As we provide recommendations to a user, he might dislike them because they are not
based on what he is looking for. For example, he might be looking for a Beatles sounding 
band, but from the 90s, or a Radiohead-like band with a female vocalist. Searching for 
music in this manner is not possible with current recommender systems or any search engine.

By using our patent-pending interface, a user can construct a tag cloud independent 
of any particular item and use this as input to the recommender, as shown in figure \ref{fig:steerable}.
The tag cloud constructed by the user describes the
parameters and concepts that are important to him. The recommender will find items similar to the user's custom
tag cloud in the same way it does it when normally finding similar items.

The user can dynamically and interactively adjust the tag
weights, receiving updated
recommendations in real time after every adjustment. This
allows the user to steer the recommender toward
areas that are of most interest to him. It is possible to shrink some tags to a negative weight to use them as a filter, removing 
any recommended item that contain the negatively weighted tags.

As mentioned earlier, every item in our system is represented by a tag cloud. Even a single tag can be considered as a tag cloud - a tag cloud of only one tag, itself. 
Therefore, any item can be used in a user constructed cloud : a tag, an artist or even another user constructed tag cloud. Users can 
save clouds and reuse them later on, either by themselves or as part of another cloud.

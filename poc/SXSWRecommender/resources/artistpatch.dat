"Welcome to the finest indie-rock trio Australia has produced to date" - Andi Garibaldi, Dead Earnest U.K.  On Drums: Kim "Arguably the greatest female drummer on the planet... like the rolling thunder from a gathering storm. Unbridled, electrifying. Also the illegitimate lovechild of Animal from the Muppets!"
On Vox/Bass: Mick "A voice which ranges from soulful compelling angst to growled whispers... as he stalks the stage; axe in hand, heart on sleeve, oozing frontman mojo." On Guitar: Pete "The mercurial, mad, and often incendiary guitarist that continually creates melodic mayhem! He is 'Pete Townshend on Uppers!'"
The HOT KICKS continue to tear up the World's rock venues!  As an independent band, The HOT KICKS maintain a steady touring regime, both internationally and locally, continually increasing their already significant fan-base around the globe.  Armed with a captivating, high-energy stage show, The HOT KICKS generate a buzz that continues to gain momentum long after the feedback dies away.

Les Handclaps <sep> bio <sep> 
From Montreal to San Francisco through Zurich and Madrid, surrounded by voluptuous go-go dancers, leather ties and slicked-back hair, the trio's objective is clear: compel you to revel without restraint to their kitsch electro-pop-y&eacute;-y&eacute; hits delivered in four languages.  Equipped with a guitar, a Farfisa and a laptop, Les Handclaps offer a diverse and festive repertoire. Led by their 50's and 60's influences, they explore pop melodies and contemporary rhythms, reinvigorating this music with an electronic treatment.  Daniel and Hugo have DJ'ed many successful nights from coast to coast, most notably New York's popular "Le One Night Stand". Add Montreal's underground icon Lo, a successful musician and singer, and "Best Live Performer" MiMi award winner who toured the world with her original music. The result is an uncommon creative force.  Their live performance is crowned by dancers Marie B&eacute;land and Marilyne St-Sauveur, both well-established on the contemporary dance scene.  The collective, having ranked as semi-finalists in the 2008 Francouvertes, brazenly steals the spotlight forcing you to clap your hands, sway your hips, do the twist, and shake your head to the sounds of their musical pastiche.  Their song "Cacti Are Delicious Fruit" was used in a televised Christmas campaign for telecommunications giant Telus from November 2008 until January 2009.  Les Handclaps will be releasing their debut full-length CD in Canada and in Europe in the Spring of 2009, followed by several regional tours.

Daddy A Go Go <sep> bio <sep> 
Daddy A Go Go is a former CNN producer John Boydston who's been making alterna-rootsy rock and roll music for kids & families since 1998.   Five of Daddy A Go Go's six CDs have made Amazon.com's "Best of the Year" critics' list and won 2 Parents Choice Awards.   The music is  most definitely electric with upfront drums, but the lyrics are pure family-oriented.  Appearing at SXSW as a quartet, The Daddy A Go Go Band is made up of Boydston's now teenage sons on guitar & bass, and another teen on drums.  The Washington Post credited Daddy A Go Go with helping change the face of kids' music by moving "playroom tunes into the pop-rock era." The New York Post enthused, "This is one hip daddy!" Kids' music authority Warren Truitt (Kidsmusic.About.com, KidsMusicThatRocks.com) has characterized Boydston's albums as "full of puns, parental pop music winks, and headbanging riffs". John Boydston lets the jokes fly and the rock and roll thunder."

T-Bird & The Breaks<sep> bio <sep> 
With a debut album, LEARN ABOUT IT (Jan. 27, 2009), inviting listeners to get to know the 11-piece band with the unleashed funk/rhythm-and-blues/soul sound, not even front man and songwriter Tim Crane, A.K.A. T Bird, could likely imagine the meteoric speed at which Austin has embraced the group (mean guitars, horn section, backup singers) and its groove (raw, chunky originals) - and discovery on a national level of the band's contemporary dynamic and cuts like its 100-proof "Blackberry Brandy," "Juice" and the hot, sexy "Esmerelda." In March, the band will showcase at the South By Southwest Music Festival in Austin.

The DeBretts <sep>  bio <sep> 
London-based, The deBretts, already heralded by Artrocker magazine as "ones to watch," and fronting the cover of Septembers Tour Dates, are a four-piece post punk-pop band with an infectious blend of Blondie/ Siouxie Sioux cool, Sex Pistols urgency and Yeah Yeah Yeahs credibility. The explosive live shows have become something of a legend and now they are ready to make their highly anticipated arrival onto our radars. 2009 will see the deBretts as an exploding force on the new music scene!  Storming into 2009 after playing a sold out show at Cool for Cats Records (Fierce Panda Records) in December, the deBretts wowed the crowds for Club NME AT KOKO on     Jan 9th, and are looking to do the same with their showcase spot at SXSW in Texas in March. "The deBretts are playing one of the best sets of the day. Their front woman is amazing to watch, sounding like a cross between Debbie Harry and Siouxie Sioux, we can't take our eyes off her" - Mobile Act Unsigned Review 08 "The deBretts' brilliance is fast outstripping my ability to find new superlatives for them, Gorgeous on record but awe-inspiring live, they will take your heart by force. Stuart M - The Mag.  "Vonnie is the star attraction- backed up by a throbbing urgent three piece; the vocal deliveries are slung out at the crowd with a mixture of revulsion and adoration, a combination that certainly leaves the audience enthralled. Definitely ones to watch!"  Artrocker

Chris Bell<sep>  bio <sep> 
The real challenge in jazz performance lies somewhere in producing music of significant depth, and presenting it in a way that is still accessible to individuals unfamiliar with the genre. Alfred Lion and Francis Wolff understood this when they started Blue Note Records in 1939. Horace Silver, Dexter Gordon, Sonny Clark, Grant Green, and many others that recorded for Blue Note through the 1950's and 60's understood the perfect balance between innovation and accessibility, and the relationship between bandstand and audience. This philosophy is still alive and groovin' with artists like Poncho Sanchez, Jovino Santos Neto, and Michel Camilo. This approach (and their immense talent) is an inspiration to me personally and our group, the Belltower 4.  By mixing originals and more contemporary standards with rhythms from Chicago to Cuba, to Sao Paolo and on to Buenos Aries, the Belltower creates accessible music with depth and integrity. On the Tunes page you can hear selections from the Belltower 4. Thanks for listening.

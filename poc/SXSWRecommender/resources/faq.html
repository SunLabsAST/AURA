<h2> Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<ol>
    <li> <b> What is this?</b> - this is a directory of artists that will be attending this year's <a href="http://sxsw.com/music/">SXSW Music Festival</a>. It includes information the artist, including a brief artist bio, links to listen to the artist, links to see the artist's videos, links to see the artist's photos and Last.fm social tags that have been applied to the artist. You can browse the artists in alphabetical order, by popularity by tag, or via a map.</li>
    <li> <b> What is SXSW?</b> From the <a href="http://sxsw.com/music/">SXSW Music</a> Site: The SXSW MUSIC AND MEDIA CONFERENCE features a legendary festival showcasing more than 1,800 musical acts of all genres from around the globe on over eighty stages in downtown Austin. By day, the Austin Convention Center comes alive with conference registrants doing business in the Trade Show and partaking of a full agenda of informative, provocative panel discussions featuring hundreds of speakers of international stature. In its 23rd year, SXSW remains an essential event on the music industry calendar.</li>

    <li> <b> Where does the info come from?</b> The artist list comes from the SXSW site:  <a href="http://sxsw.com/music/shows/bands"> Offical SXSW Showcasing bands </a>.  The artist info comes from Last.fm (via their <a href="http://www.last.fm/api">ultra-nifty web services</a>),  and the links to videos were created using the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/getting_started.html#data_api">Youtube Data API</a>. To create the google maps, the artist's hometown was geo-encoded using Google's <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/services.html#Geocoding">geocoding web service</a>, and the maps were built using the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/">Google Maps API</a>. Photos are shown using the simple Flickr slide show URL scheme. The 'hotness' metric is obtained via the mighty fine <a href="http://developer.echonest.com/">Echo Nest developer APIs</a></li>
    <li><b> What is this 'Hotness'? </b> This is a somewhat experimental addition that shows how 'hot' an artist is, based on the current level of buzz around an artist in the music blogosphere.  The Hotness metric comes from the musical brain at <a href="the.echonest.com">The Echo Nest</a>. If no 'hotness' metric for an artist is shown, it doesn't necessarily mean that the band is not hot, it could just mean that we couldn't find find the data.</li>
    <li><b> What is this 'Rising'? </b> This shows the artists that are 'Hot' but have few listeners.  These are the bands that are getting a lot of buzz, but are still relatively unknown.  (Thanks to Chris Gaines for suggesting this metric).</li>
    <li> <b> Why did you make this?</b> I am going to be attending SXSW this year - so I wanted to make sure that I saw all of the best bands - but I found the list of 1,200 or so artists (most of whom I had never heard of) to be rather daunting, and so I decided that I'd create a catalog that would include all the context that I'd need to decide if I'd like to see a particular band.</li>
    <li> <b> Hey! Some of the info is wrong!</b> Resolving  artists with an API such as from Last.fm or Youtube is not an exact science.  There are all sorts of reasons why things can go astray. But I'd like to fix as many errors as I can, so if you see an error, let me know.</li>
    <li><b> This catalog is really ugly!</b> That's not a question.  And I'm not a designer. If you have some design skills and want to make the catalog look nice, go for it.</li>
    <li><b>Didn't Last.fm do something like this last year?</b> They <a href="http://www.last.fm/group/SXSW+Music">did</a>, and it was much better than this catalog since it gave you personalized recommendations.  I hope they do it again this year too. <i>Update</i> <a href="http://go.gtmcknight.com/">Taylor McKnight</a> has tweaked the site's CSS, so it looks much better. Thanks Taylor!</li>
    <li><b> I have an idea for a new feature!</b> Great. Let me know and I'll see what I can do.</li>
    <li><b> Any disclaimers or policies I need to know?</b> Here's the stuff the Sun lawyers like me to add to web pages: <a href="http://www.sun.com/privacy/">Privacy</a>  <a href="http://www.sun.com/termsofuse.html">Terms of Use</a> <a href="http://www.sun.com/suntrademarks/"> Trademarks</a>. This catalog is not affiliated with SXSW.</li>
    <li> <b> Who built this?</b> That's me, Paul Lamere.  I'm a researcher at Sun Labs, where I build systems for exploring and discovering music.  You can send me mail at <a href="mailto:Paul.Lamere@gmail.com">Paul.Lamere@gmail.com</a>.

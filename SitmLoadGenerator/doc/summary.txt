Project Aura Load Test Report
October 31, 2008

Summary
-------
We perform load tests on the Project Aura datastore to determine how many users
a 16-way datastore can support. The tests show that a 16-way datastore exceed our
performance goal of supporting 10K simultaneous users.

Description
-----------
The tests involve simulating the activity of a number of users.
Each simulated user performs an activity after a random delay (the
delay can be between 2 and 150 seconds). The activity performed by the user
includes searching for artists, searching for tags, finding similar artists, 
finding similar tags, finding artists similar to an ever-changing word
cloud, etc.  A user activity such as an artist search is converted to a web
service API call that is made to one of the instances of the web service
that is running on tastekeeper.com.  The XML result returned is parsed,
and checked for errors.  The XML result also contains timing data that
indicates how long it took to process the request on the server. This allows
us to separate transport and network delays from actual processing time.
Some user activity may generate  multiple requests to tastekeeper so there
isn't necessarily a one-to-one correspondence between user activity and API
calls.

There are a number of factors that affect these tests:

  - test client speed - a test client can only support a certain number of
    users.  A desktop class machine (our workstations and laptops) can each
    simulate about 2,000 users while search.east can simulate about 6,000
    users. In our tests, we are using lur, zoidburg, bobism, search, and a
    number of laptops as test clients.

  - network latency - the time it takes to ping the web server. Ping times
    from SWAN to the grid are about 60 ms. The ping time from my home network 
    is about 100 ms

  - network bandwidth - the amount of data that can be shipped over the
    network per second. The bandwidth needed and used for these tests
    is unknown, but is assumed to be sufficient.

  - Tomcat web server instances - each Tomcat instance seems to be able to support
    around 2K to 3K users.  There may be some configuration changes
    that we could make to increase this number.  We have implemented and
    deployed a load balancer - but currently the load balancer imposes an
    unacceptably high overhead (175ms for a single Tomcat  vs. 875ms for a
    load balanced Tomcat). The load balancer is not used in these tests.

  -  Aura configuration - we are currently running with a 16-way datastore
     with 20K artists.

Our performance goal for the 16-way datastore is to be able to support
10,000 active users.  We consider the test to be a success if we have less
than a 500ms average time per API call (including transport and processing) 
for the 10K users.

We've performed the tests in a number of different configuration, varying the
number of users, the number of test clients and the number of web servers
instances used.  The following table summarizes the tests. TotAvgTime shows
the average total round trip time for all web API calls. TotProcTime shows the
average processing time on the server.

#Users  #Clients    #WebServers     TotAvgTime  TotProcTime

10000   3           4               250         107
12000   5           6               350         180
14000   5           6               469         247
16000   6           7               638         277

The tests show that with a 16 way datastore with 4 web servers we can support 
more than  10K users.  With 10K users the datastore is handling nearly 
400 wep API requests per second. These requests are non-trivial operations such 
as searching, finding similar artists etc.  

This performance compares favorably to the performance of a popular search engine such as Google.  In 2006, google.uk was processing about 300 searches per second.

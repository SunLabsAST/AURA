Goal
----
   - Scale to one million entries
   - Use a real database
   - Use real document similarity for recommendations
   - Deploy outside of the firewall so we can get the recommendations
     into google reader


Features:
--------
   - mult-threaded crawler
   - about 10,000 blog feeds

Issues:
------
   - Difficult to detect memory leak in the crawler prevented us for running
     for more than about 24 hours at a time.
   - Similarity queries are taking around 10 seconds with a db size of .5 
     million entires
   - Monolitic structure makes all debugging difficult
   - Shutting down the crawler and search engine can take a while (a minute 
     or more) - this can cause problems for the app container
   - The url of an entry is not a sufficient key - it is not always
     the same (many aggregators have multiple entry links for the same
     entry) - we need to perhaps use an entries GUID as the key.  This
     problem leads to many duplicates in the recommendations (and no
     doubt many dups in the database)
   - Fragile locking in the search engine caused problems with startup
     and merging
   - Enrolling a new user - it can take some time before we can
     generate recommedations for a new user (we have to wait until the
     crawler identifies *new* starred items).
   - User interface is *ugly* - in particular:
       - no way to add more 'starred item ' feeds for a user
       - no way to edit feeds
   - Poor recommendations:
      - lots of dups
      - lots of stale entries
      - lots of irrelevant entries
      - lack of recommendation explanations

   - Supplied feed has many entries that don't show the content in
     Google Reader - instead shows <html> or <text>
   

Status
------
   - System deployed on Dec 7 3PM, is crawling about 5K entries per
     hour
   - Using a real database - no query time issues so far
   - Recommendations in google reader


Retrospective
-------------
Sometimes the recommendations that we get are very good - but the
bulkd of them seem poor - duplicates or irrelevance seems to overwhelm
the system

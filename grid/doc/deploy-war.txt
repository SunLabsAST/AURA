How to deploy a war file
========================

Here's an example of deploying DBBrowse to www.tastekeeper.com:

cd <aura-checkout>/grid/bin
./deployWar -n www -w ../../DBBrowse/dist/DBBrowse.war

Here's an exampe of deploying the web services to
music.tastekeeper.com:

cd <aura-checkout>/grid/bin
./deployWar -n music -w ../../SitmWebServices/dist/SitmWebServices.war

Because of the way that tomcat wants to reference the files, you
must run these scripts from the bin directory so that the relative
paths work correctly.

Also note that the tomcat instances now mount the distribution file
system as /files/dist, so you can use the local deployment option of
tomcat if you want to redeploy the same war file.

How to deploy a war file to a different path
============================================

Using the script, it's easy to deploy a war file to a different path.
For example, to deploy The Explaura as the root Web app on
music.tastekeeper.com, you can say:

cd <aura-checkout>/grid/bin
./deployWar -n music -p / -w ../../WebMusicExplaura/dist/WebMusicExplaura.war

You can use any path as the value of the -p argument, for example:

cd <aura-checkout>/grid/bin
./deployWar -n sjg -p /foo -w ../../DBBrowse/dist/DBBrowse.war

will deploy the db browser so that it's accessible at:

http://sjg.tastekeeper.com/foo

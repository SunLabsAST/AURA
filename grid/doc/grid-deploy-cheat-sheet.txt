Paul's cheatsheet for deploying apps.


1) stop the grid:

    bin/stopSitm
    bin/stopAura

2) Using grid accessor tool, destroy registrations (except for the tomcat
ones)

3) upload the distribution:

    ant upload-dist

4) Start things:

    bin/startAura

    (monitor the start with the grid accessor tool, once everything is
    going ...)

    bin/startSitm

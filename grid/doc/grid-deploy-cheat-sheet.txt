Paul's cheatsheet for deploying apps.

0) Fire up the grid accessor tool so you can watch things.

1) stop the grid:

    bin/stopSitm
    bin/stopAura

    - wait for all of the aura registrations to stop running (about 1 minute)

2) Using grid accessor tool, destroy registrations (except for the tomcat
ones)  - this usually means destroying all registrations that start with 
the instance prefix (often 'live-');

3) upload the distribution:

    ant upload-dist

4) Start things:

    bin/startAura

    (monitor the start with the grid accessor tool, once everything is
    going ...)

    bin/startSitm


-----------------------
To redeploy tomcat:

cd grid-deploy
ant -f tomcat.xml

How to start a tomcat server on-grid
====================================

You can start a non-load-balanced tomcat in the following way:

cd <aura-checkout>/grid/bin
./startTomcat -n foo

where "foo" is the name of the tomcat that you want to start.  This
shell script (and the ant script that it calls) will take care of
uploading tomcat to the grid, making the appropriate file systems,
network settings, and processes for the web server.

The result is a tomcat instance listening on port 80 on a host called
foo.tastekeeper.com.

The grid instance that's used is taken from your .caroline file, and
that affects the on-grid network that will be used for this deployment
and therefore the data store that any Web apps will be able to connect
to.

You can start a set of load-balanced tomcat in the following way:

cd <aura-checkout>/grid/bin
./startLBTomcats -b <start number> -c <count> -n <name>

Load-balanced tomcats are numbered.  This script can be used to start
up an initial set of load-balanced tomcats or to add a number of
tomcat instances to a load-balanced set.  For example, to start a set
of load-balanced tomcats, you can say:

cd <aura-checkout>/grid/bin
./startLBTomcats -b 1 -c 5 -n www

which will start tomcats numbered 1 through 5.  The instances will be
called www-1 through www-5.  These names will be used internally to
the grid only.  None of the instances is exposed to the external
network. 

Once the tomcat instances have started, the load balancer
configuration is modified so that it's load balancing those
instances.  Currently, the load balancer is tied to an external name
binding so that lb.tastekeeper.com points to the load-balanced
tomcats.

You could add more tomcats using an invocation like the following:

cd <aura-checkout>/grid/bin
./startLBTomcats -b 6 -c 3 -n <name>

which will add tomcats named www-6 through www-8 to the load-balanced
set.

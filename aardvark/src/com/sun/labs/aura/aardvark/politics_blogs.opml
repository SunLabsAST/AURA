      <outline text="Spend 1/4 of the money telling everyone how you're using 1/2 of the money to help people. This proves that your Presidency will be about solving problems, because you're not waiting to get elected to solve problems. (I predict this will raise you even more money, for you to spend on helping people, and the idea is so fresh, it might actually help you get elected, but even if it doesn't you'll have the satisfaction of knowing that you not only helped people in a real way, but you also helped people feel positive about politics. I think net-net this is why a lot of people got behind Dean, something that Dean himself never really appreciated. They wanted to do something powerful to help their country. Politicians tend to be cynical, so they don't get that many people are not inherently cynical.)"/>

      <outline text="Giuliani has no basis for running on his ability to defend the country against terrorism, other than an impression that he made some people feel better when he appeared on TV after the 9-11 attacks. I didn't have a TV then, so I remain perhaps the only American who doesn't have fond memories of Giuliani, who I remember as a brash district attorney, definitely not Presidential material. New York politics, even though NY is our biggest city, is a very small little world. "/>

One thing I'm not clear on is if Moveon.org is taking cheap shots at McCain for his gaffe about bombing Iran (which was insensitive, btw, to the Iranians who would die and the Americans who would risk their lives to drop the bombs).

      <outline text="I've heard it said we're exploiting other people's pain. I suppose almost any event could be spun that way. For example, when the President says we should wait six months before judging his troop surge, a lot of people are going to die because of that, and anyone who is critical of his plan might be seen as exploiting their pain. It's in times of crisis like this that we learn the most about our values and how they compare to others. A lot of learning happens. There are always people calling foul, so be it. (People used to say who was I to write about tech, then they said I shouldn't write about politics. I said don't read it if you don't like it.)"/>

      <outline text="At the same point in my life that Imus made me laugh, so did Kurt Vonnegut. I loved his books when I was young, and I made a point, four years ago, to re-read most of his books, so I've got an updated appreciation for how wonderful they are. And they were made more important for me because I shared his writing with my uncle, who had (I felt) a similar sense of humor, of irony. Like many others of my generation, Vonnegut formed my perspective on the world, on mysticism, and politics, on the smallness of everything we care about. If you've read Sirens of Titan, my favorite Vonnegut book, you know what I'm talking about. No spoilers here!"/>

      <outline text="I volunteered to convert the RSS 2.0 site from a dynamic Manila-hosted site to a static Apache-hosted site. I'm moving all the images and sample XML files into sub-folders of the static HTML pages. We will also offer the whole site as a zip archive so people can download it in total. I will also provide the Harvard webmaster with an htaccess file that redirects the old urls to the new ones. I'm trying to anticipate the nit-picking that such a change is likely to cause, but I'm hopeful that with the recent Kathy Sierra mess, people will be reluctant to get so personal about it. All I'm doing is helping my friends at Harvard deliver on their commitment to provide an unchanging home for a spec that a lot of people build on. I am being careful not to change one word of the spec. Yet I'm sure, as I write this, that some people will spin as if they were on a Sunday morning politics show, hoping to confuse good people into thinking that changes were made. That's just the context our work take..."/>

They often do. "/>
      <outline text="I want them to have a blogger on their editorial page, two or three times a week, someone who comes from our world, someone who will hear what we learn. I know that even if they don't agree with my politics and vice versa, I will get a respectful hearing from most bloggers. That's a great first step for any publication to begin the integration with the blogging world. I suppose it seems risky, but you're going to have to take some risks, big ones, to turn this corner and survive. "/>

Nope, Anderson Cooper is covering the lost Carolina kid. His chubby dad is on screen, finally even he looks tired. Glad the kid is okay. Sorry our country is so fucked."/>

      <outline text="Politics is all of a sudden interesting. The Congress is organizing across (as opposed to along) party lines. Yesterday on NewsHour, senior Republican Senator John Warner from Virginia sounded more like the opposition than a member of the same party as the President. It's a miracle to see discourse come back to national politics. We are still in a very dark period, but it's getting brighter. And once again the brilliance and luck that's designed into our system is saving our ass. John Adams and Thomas Jefforson hated each other after George Washington left office peacefully and Jefferson's cousin John Marshall had guts. We're living in a country whose political system is largely formed around the personalities of these four men."/>

      <outline text="Back in the mid-90s, my first reaction to XML was to retch in horror at the inevitable politics that such a beast would certainly evoke. Back then I was very happy to be working on the web, I thought of it as the platform with no platform vendor, and I saw XML as a way of inviting all the would-be and former platform vendors back in to rule our lives, and prevent us from having any fun or making any money. Eventually I was won over, for one main reason -- interop is important. If I make software that has an open and easy to understand protocol for communicating with other instances of itself, then other people can write plug-compatible software, and users can choose between products based on features, performance and price, not compatibility. I had already seen the world melt down several times as the technology industry fought to form lock-in through various schemes to delude people into thinking they were open to being replaced, when they were anything but."/>

Big negatives for the press for not running the various verbal gaffes of the Decider-in-Chief, when he attacked Kerry. There was a chance to help US politics get out of Swift Boat mode. Yeah I do think it's their job to help our political system. Also, how about a survey of voters asking if they regret re-electing Bush?

At the point where the candidates were allowed to ask the other guy a question, the Governor asked Angelides what was the funniest moment so far in his campaign. You had to laugh, he asked his opponent a friendly question. How unusual in American politics. How un-Republican. You know, that one question undid all the ads the Dems are running with him campaigning for George W Bush in 2004. "/>

Ironically, he was told that by someone whose politics are very similiar to his, as mine are to both of theirs. This is terrible. It probably has something to do with why liberals are so ineffective. Differences should not cut off discourse. That's the lesson of the last six years. The Republican leadership have raped our country, all of us equally, while we squandered every opportunity to work together. That must become our new party, The Working Together to Make America Better Party. "/>

This is the first item on cutandrunnow.com, a chronology of declining Republican support for the war in Iraq. (Will Cate sends an email noting that the CNN story is from 2005, which certainly predates the &quot;cut and run&quot; sliming tactic.

I totally tuned it out every time the press became obsessed about it, there was always some news report that didn't go crazy, but now there's not. I've gotten in the habit of watching Countdown every night at 9PM on MSNBC, it's biased, but it's biased in my way, always taking the dimmest view of Bush, without going into total fantasy-land. And last night, with President Clinton suggesting the obvious, that President Bush is using the supposed terror crisis in Britain as an excuse to bash Democrats, they spent 45 minutes on some development in this 10 year old murder case. How many Iraqis died yesterday? How many Americans died in Iraq? How's the Lebanon peace thing working out? What about the hysterical passenger on the flight from London to NY? Not one word on Countdown. All through the show Olbermann is making lame excuses for what they made him do, obviously they're trying for more ratings. I couldn't let this pass without saying..."/>

First, we're both 51, and basically happy with it. We talked about that. We're both from the Bay Area, but from opposite ends, she from Santa Cruz and me from Berkeley. But then the politics of both places are more or less the same, wacked out left coast political hippie. She worked to save New Orleans in the aftermath of Katrina, and I went down to have a look post-Katrina. Neither of our work is done, but I have a strong feeling that the connection betw Grace and myself is going to create a path that lots of men and lots of women go down, working together, to make the world a happier, more fair and better-running place.

      <outline text="I had my phone talk this morning with Lisa Williams, who will lead the Emotional Life discussion on Friday at BloggerCon IV. It'll be the third instance, the first was led by John Perry Barlow, the second by Julie Leung. The idea is simple, blogs aren't just about tech or politics or business, sometimes they're about people, and sometimes they play a big role in helping us get through difficult times. Sometimes it's real simple, here are the lives we lead and how they relate to others. Sometimes the truth is so close to the surface, there can be no masks, who we are comes out through our online persona. This is the riskiest topic we tackle, it's the double-diamond slope of BloggerCon, but it's also potentially the most rewarding. "/>

Nobody is going to be telling him that his words are out of place. Something else happens for the rest of us, Mr. In Touch. The point about liberty is that if you want it, everybody else has to have it also. Mr Blair's statements are not going to be censored - he is the prime minister - and says nothing which could possibly be thought of as worth censoring. It's only when you come out with ideas that someone wants to censor you. Nobody wants to censor platitudes and chumpish remarks about 'community'."/>

      <outline text="I've given guest talks at two Markoff journalism classes, one at UC-Berkeley and one at Stanford. At the Stanford one we talked about coverage of City Hall, which he pointed out was a problem, as professional journalism was retracting, it was leaving civic politics uncovered. I may have pointed out, probably did, that the people can fill in and increase coverage of civic politics. I vaguely recall that Markoff was unconvinced. But as time has passed I've become more sure this is the answer, and that the respective role of professional and amateur is that of editor and reporter, teacher and student, coach and player. There is a relationship, but it's a new one, and newness is always hard (but often fun). "/>

      <outline text="Fantastic piece in today's SF Chron about the new eastern span of the Bay Bridge. I thought the bridge was almost finished, but not nearly so. It won't open until 2014, according to the plan, which doesn't really exist, yet (even though construction is quite far along). The original plan called for the bridge to be completed by 2004, but politics interfered. But it wasn't rational politics, about where the most resources go, it was about esthetics. A completely functional replacement for the not-quake-safe eastern span could have already been deployed, but the mayors of each of the cities wanted something ornamental that would look stunning and be famous world-wide, like the Golden Gate Bridge is, on the other side of SF. They also worried about how the ramps toward each of their cities would look. Oy. And you thought software industry politics was bad! (BTW, there was a small quake today in the East Bay, a reminder that there are important non-esthetic reasons to finish the new bridge..."/>

      <outline text="The Conversation Market is an exciting, if volatile, place to be. One can get good results in a Conversation Garden. It takes a lot of time and quite draining personal politics. I've done it. It's taken numerous bitter attacks from Mrs Discipline's friends (including having your words changed, getting given lots of 'points'), and playing lots of legalistic and moralistic games to prove that what I said didn't contravene rules, or that Mrs Discipline's friends were acting unfairly or in contravention of their own rules. Eventually, you reach a plateau where people don't bother harrassing you or playing games. But it's such a waste of time compared to the Market."/>

The 20th Century is fading and the new century is going strong. There really was a big shift as the calendar rolled over, and I'm totally glad to be a part of it."/>
      <outline text="Dave is going to quit blogging. I agree with the technological stuff in his post. It's not finished, but it's mostly done. I think that he's not right on the political front. We're not going to see bloggers in the House of Representatives. We're going to see Congressmen with blogs. That's a different thing altogether. It's hardly going to be an unedited voice of a person. It's going to be an edited voice of a composite - a political shell of a person combined with his marketing department. Politics is still tied to Reagan, but not in the way that small government people want. It's tied to Reagan because Reagan was an actor, a man who impersonates other men. That's what politics is going to be for a long time."/>

      <outline text="After a full week of intense politics, I'm getting a little time to write some code this evening. What a relief. The first thing I did was write a script that adds 10 random songs to the queue. When I browse through the playlist I'm not getting any new ideas. This script, which will certainly become a command is an idea generator. The first song it picked was Do You Love Me? Yes, I do! "/>
      <outline text="Wired: Blame it on the RIAA. &quot;Last year the music labels successfully lobbied to insert in unrelated legislation a clause that prevents copyrights from reverting to their authors.

      <outline text="Over the years, often around my birthday, or holidays, I've written stories that were not about technology or politics. I feel that these are some of the most important pieces I've written. "/>
      <outline text="Wired: &quot;'While the Internet and MP3 technology provide budding artists without recording contracts with an inexpensive vehicle for communicating their work to the public, the predominant use of MP3 technology is the trafficking of pirated sound recordings,' said a statement in the written court documents filed by the RIAA.&quot;"/>

      <outline text="Went to dinner last night with people from Allaire and IBM (Andre was there too) to talk about very technical implementation details. Went to a cheesy Indonesian restaurant in Rembrandt Plain, then walked through the red light district and ended in a coffee shop on Dam Square. Didn't get in until 1:30AM, now it's 8:30, drinking coffee and trying to get awake so I can hold my own amidst the most intense industry politics I've ever been involved in. "/>
      <outline text="I'm in the increasingly less-awkward role of being both a participant and a reporter. I think that's what makes this site interesting, it's what makes all weblogs interesting. This is what the New Economy is about to me. An open-ness to your thinking process. Welcoming other people in. Creating value by inclusion, and using that to help perpetuate the process. No lines between reportage and politics, a routing-around of the stubbornness of the business and technology press to stick to their well-rehearsed stories. "/>
      <outline text="I got a new POV on this in the early days of SOAP. When I showed up at Microsoft, there was Don Box. When a new team took over SOAP, there was Don Box. Again and again. Although I'm not inside the COM world, my sense is that Don is the #1 COM developer as far as Microsoft is concerned. And that's not because he kisses ass (although I'm sure he's adept at MS politics), nor due to his brilliance or that he lives for wire protocols. I think the most important thing is his committment to work with Microsoft. Take the good with the bad, try not to take things personally. And when they ask you to come back, you show up."/>

He explained that he had equal rights, and was entitled to express an opinion about a matter of national interest. People told him to stick to civil rights. I know how he feels. People tell me to stick to technology. To which I say pfui. You think I worked so hard to create this stuff just so other people could tell me what to think about politics? NFW."/>
      <outline text="Green Fairy is absolutely correct about the Observer Women's Monthly: &quot;Mentions of politics, of any description: 0. Mention of the arts: 0. Mentions of business, money or jobs: 0. Mentions of science or technology, 0. Difference from any number of glossy women's magazines available that peddle emancipation and freedom because they can say 'blow job' while fetishing a level of forever unattainable perfect living that maybe, just maybe, next month's edition will have the secret to cracking: 0.&quot; And so it goes on, that bandwagon."/>

      <outline text="Hello worldThis is mainly a trial blog that I'm using to learn about OPML, to compare NewsRiver with other aggregators, and to think about ways to organise information. I'm an OPML newbie. Thanks to Dave for getting me interested in this.Apart from OPML/&quot;river of news&quot; related stuff, I'll probably end up blogging eclectic things about technology, culture and politics.I'm English, a former geology student, and have a job unrelated to IT."/>
      <outline text="Wonkette is discussing how Jonathon &quot;The Impaler&quot; Sharkey, &quot;Satanic Dark Priest, Sanguinarian Vampyre and a Hecate Witch&quot;, is running for the Governor of Minnesota. I'd rather vote for him than one of George W. Bush or one of his fundamentalist fanatics."/>
      <outline text="Gordon Brown is currently revealing his tedious old ideas about British unity and the possibility of setting up &quot;British Day&quot; - in the spirit of America's Fourth of July celebrations. He has a tendency when things aren't going well or things are rather boring in politics to draw this card out. He already wrote about it in Prospect magazine a few months back. Part of what gets me is that he has the gall to use the words &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;liberty&quot;, when he has served on a government which has ransacked Britain of any of it's traditional liberties. We are set to have a law which will threaten the liberty of free speech. We've seen drastic increases in police powers. This is a government that has locked people up without trial and dismissed due process as a nineteenth century technicality. Why, exactly, should anyone take Mr Brown seriously when he uses the word liberty?"/>

      <outline text="Dawkins brings, in both this programme and his other writings, an admirable moral zeal. His secular critics seem to object to this moral vision, believing instead the superstition that moral facts can arise from mere circumstance. This superstition is most plain to see when you watch people talk about politics on television. For instance, they'll say things like &quot;So many people are now using drugs! We must do something!&quot;. By the very fact of their drug use, we have a moral imperative? Of course not! Either we believe that drug use is justified in banning drugs, or we do not. It does not depend on the number of users. Would murder be justified if everybody did it?"/>

This is an interesting topic I've been thinking about.  I mean, I buy these iPods, an iBook, gasoline, occaisionally shop at Wal-Mart, watch 3 TV shows, purchase tracks from iTunes, have a mobile phone...  A lot of it feeds into a system that I don't like.  So, do we just try to regulate how much we support big business, sweatshop labor, monoculture and right-wing politics?  Even when we detest them voraciously?  i don't know.  I guess I could join those dumpster divers in New York.  ;-)"/>
      <outline text="The presumptuous &quot;preaction&quot; to Dawkins' programme only backs up one of his main theses - that society sets religion up to be something very special and to be discussed uncritically, as opposed to politics.  Imagine if he'd made a programme about how the personality clash of, say, Ariel Sharon and the late Yasser Arafat, or the clash of the secular Western world and the (secular) traditionalist Arab world, was the reason behind the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The reaction would not be as hyperbolic."/>

Adam Curry did not censor GoyFire. He expressed concern and played other's concern on the DSC but did not censor, and spent a few days discussing it. He left it up to the conscience of the Politics noder on the indiepodder directory which is why it's still listed. If expressing concern and discussing what should be done is censorship, then everybody's a damn censor.

The fantastic thing about them is that as I build one, it's not a project in and of itself, but it's a kickstart for a thousand projects; it's laying the ground work for a hundred new buildings. But, as we've seen recently, the thing which is most important is to get the grounding absolutely right - pure and without mistakes. The OPML Community (and I use that word reluctantly) could build something fantastic. Look at what indiepodder.org have achieved. They've got some silly top-level categories on there - why Trucking and Tequila? - but also some good ones - Philosophy and Religion are seperate, and it annoys me quite a lot when they are together. Then there are some messed up things. In Politics, there should really be some separation by country and political affiliation.

      <outline text="OK, sorry for all the politics.  How about some fun links?  If you are my age you may fondly remember the Choose You Own Adventure books starting with The Cave of Time.  You would read a page or two and then have to make a decision and go to either of two or three pages to continue.  It was kind of a pre-computer computer role-playing game.  The site I linked about has a blurb about most of the books that were published.  And here is a link to a different site with an analysis, this one of the brutal &quot;The Third Planet from Altair.&quot;  I believe I still have a few of these in a book box.

      <outline text="The Club for Growth had a new blog Social Security.  What a perfect example of what were fighting against:Congressman Sherry Boehlert, one of the Houseâ??s leading RINOs, had this to say about Social Security in a recent radio interview:

â??OMB, CBO, and all these alphabet agencies in Washington that monitor these things tell us the Trust fund has sufficient resources in it to pay benefits well into ah, ah, three decades now.â?

Ummm, thatâ??s not true. As any congressman should know, the Trust Fund has ZERO cash in it. Instead, the Trust Fund has paper IOUs that represent the Trust Fundâ??s obligations, not assets. But heck, since Boehlert referenced a government agency, letâ??s get a quote from one of them. Hereâ??s what the CBO has to say about it:

However, trust fund holdings, which are invested in Treasury bonds, are liabilities to the rest of the government (which will need to pay for the bonds when they are redeemed). Thus, such holdings are not assets of the government..."/>

I want to thank you personally for what you did in the election -- you rewrote the book on grassroots politics, taking control of campaigns away from big donors. No campaign will ever be the same.

You moved voters, helped hold George Bush accountable, and countered the attacks from big news organizations such as Fox, Sinclair Broadcasting, and conservative talk radio.

And your efforts count now more than ever. Despite the words of cooperation and moderate sounding promises, this administration is planning a right wing assault on values and ideals we hold most deeply. Healthy debate and diverse opinion are being eliminated from the State Department and CIA, and the cabinet is being remade to rubber stamp policies that will undermine Social Security, balloon the deficit, avoid real reforms in health care and education, weaken homeland security, and walk away from critical allies around the ..."/>

      <outline text="As I mentioned earlier I've been posting on political topics quite a bit recently.  But I still talk about other stuff - an frankly I know some of my readers (my wife included) aren't all the interested in my admittedly left-leaning political musings.  To that end I have made a CasdraBlog - No Politics link which does pretty much what it says, eliminates the political posts.

This is possible thanks to my move to WordPress and a cool WordPress plugin, Show Categories.  Thanks Kitten!

Then I read Matthew Yglesias' analysis of the Iraq sections of President Bush's convention speech:&quot;Again, my opponent and I have different approaches. I proposed, and the Congress overwhelmingly passed, $87 billion in funding needed by our troops doing battle in Afghanistan and Iraq. My opponent and his running mate voted against this money for bullets, and fuel, and vehicles, and body armor.&quot;

The president proposed $87 billion in funding for the troops and for reconstruction. John Kerry voted for a proposal to finance this by rescinding some of Bush's tax cuts for the wealthy. The president said that if such a bill passed, he would veto it. Kerry said that if the bill came up without the amendment, he would vote against it. So Kerry's position is this -- we should only spend the money if we have the money to spend in our treasury. Bush's position is this -- we should only spend the money if doing so does not imperil the fortunes..."/>

That they yell, so loudly, saying nothing but dirt, responding only by trying to change the subject, says one thing to me. The trail leads to them.

The President announced a task force to investigate the claims of Weapons of Mass Destruction. The US government budget for 2005 is fresh news, and the President, who's looking weak against the Democrats, is going on Meet the Press on Sunday.

      <outline text="It's not surprising to me, in a way, that weblogs have become such an important part of the early 2004 presidential campaign. I expect this campaign will take place more on the Web than it does on TV networks. That's why I think candidates who use the Web to raise money for TV ads aren't making enough of a bet on the Web, and are leaving the door open for those who do. But it must be hard to let go of a way of life. Politics has &quot;always&quot; worked that way, right? Anyway, it's surprising when a vision comes true, no matter how strongly you felt it would. "/>

      <outline text="I believe that China and Iran, both of which theoretically have one-party-systems, and the two-party systems of the west will experience an upheaval soon because of the Internet. Diversity is the rule. Politics isn't one-size-fits-all. Sure we have some common interests. But the Chinese government is as obsolete as the centralized media it depends on. In the future every citizen will define his or her own political party, along with his or her interests, beliefs, and whatever it is that makes people different from each other."/>
      <outline text="I thought weblogs would rewrite the rules of US politics, but I thought it would happen slowly, and come from the ground up: that one candidate, perhaps for local office, would use a weblog well, and others would follow, and in a few years a weblog would be an assumed part of a political presence, much as telephones and airplanes are today.

If they decide to do it at a strategic level, I want the programmer who does the work to be delighted with how easy it is, to be so excited that he wants to go all the way and make it their default format. This gives users choice, and it's been proven over and over that they don't move until they have choice (or believe they will get it). Omni is hardly a threat to my company, they're not much larger than we are, and their product is loved by many of the same people who love our software, so what the heck, let's be compatible.

It usually means that the normal forms of hierarchy are subverted, and people have a more open form of communication. And as far as I can tell, developing software is all about peer level communication and cooperation within your group, and with your corner of the industry! When I finally moved into technical exec positions and started implementing teams with these characteristics, I was amazed at the &quot;mostly&quot; successful results.

I doubt if Microsoft would have much trouble recruiting an enthusiastic team of internal developers to work on this project. After all, it would be a key part of clearing the way for Microsoft to create new software, that runs everywhere, without supervision from lawyers. Microsoft truly does like to make software.

      <outline text="Last week, an Internet PR blitz from Clinton, some scheduled some spontaneous (the PR response to the denial of service attacks). More lies and grandstanding, and even a not-refuted rumor that Clinton will become an Internet entrepreneur after he leaves office. Oy. It's politics as a TV show. Business as usual. The groggy Clinton who talked straight to the Davos crowd treats the US electorate as if it doesn't have a mind. "/>

      <outline text="But silly shit like this is just a pimple on the ass of the long- term consequences for politics, art and education.  You have passed a law that will get less respect than the 55 m.p.h. speed limit dead bang in the middle of the First Amendment.  Indecency is nothing but a matter of fashion; obscenity is the same but on a longer timeline.  This generation freely reads James Joyce and Henry Miller and the Republic still stands.

      <outline text="Microsoft and Apple and Sun, etc are big companies with hairy politics. White boys and icons. Lots of fear."/>
      <outline text="As I see it, people who were in a position to learn the lessons of the sixties never made a concentrated effort to enter mainstream politics and transform things from within, with the result that the US Senate is very old, very white and very isolated. If the Exon bill had originated in the House, it never would have passed in the form that it did -- because the House (last November notwithstanding) is way more pluralistic, diverse and young than the Senate. I may hate Newt Gingrich, but I do respect him, and I know that as a major SciFi fan who made the famous &quot;let-them-eat-laptops&quot; speech, he would have risen to the occasion and denounced it had it come up for a vote on his watch."/>
      <outline text="One of the pages in my personal section is a list of my favorite movies. No need to list them here. I just added another one to the list today -- Being There, with Peter Sellers, released in 1979. A beautiful movie, way ahead of its time, with a wonderful title and cast, a light plot, but it makes a huge statement -- that reality is less than we think it is. That gardening and loving and simply *being* is enough. That everything else is just a big misunderstanding. Chauncey Garndener, played by Sellers, becomes a central figure in world politics, totally by accident. The ending of the movie delivers the message that to be an angel you just share your love and speak the truth. The simpler it is, the better. "/>

Perhaps this is because incubating standards can enjoy the quiet, perhaps they grow better and more healthily outside the mostly irrelevent politics that infect all large organizations. "/>
      <outline text="Anyway, for the next product I needed to be the moderator of an online talk show. Perhaps this time I've found my calling? I love this stuff, it's a great combination of technology and politics. I've found that I'm happiest when you turn up the volume on both of these things. So I'm happy. "/>

      <outline text="Control of the initiative is control of the battle. In the alley, at the poker table or in politics. One must raise. The American public chose Bush over Kerry in 2004. How, the undecided electorate rightly wondered, could one believe that Kerry would stand up for America when he could not stand up to Bush? A possible response to the Swift boat veterans would have been: &quot;I served. He didn't. I didn't bring up the subject, but, if all George Bush has to show for his time in the Guard is a scrap of paper with some doodling on it, I say the man was a deserter.&quot; "/>
      <outline text="This would have been a raise. Here the initiative has been seized, and the opponent must now fume and bluster and scream unfair. In combat, in politics, in poker, there is no certainty; there is only likelihood, and the likelihood is that aggression will prevail. "/>

      <outline text="But on some level, of course, the critiques are about politics, and rightly so. Democracy is a bit of a crude instrument. Public officials have strong incentives to direct funds away from dull-but-worthy endeavors and toward well-financed interest groups. Likewise, they have strong incentives to staff agencies with cronies rather than competent professionals. Insofar as they act otherwise they do so for one reason -- fear. Fear that the political consequences of exposure of wrongdoing and mismanagement will be swift and severe. Unless voters and the press demand the heads of officials who screw up, future screw-ups are guaranteed."/>

      <outline text="I have purposely avoided commenting about Katrina, sitting safe over here in the UK. But as it has unravelled accross blogs, and the media I have become more and more confused as to the lack of preperation and action, it's like I'm watching an unrealistic movie. I keep saying to myself this is happening in America not some third world island, surely they must have better plans and crisis response, but unfortunately it appears not. The coverage over hear has become very negative to the administration, and much I read now online is similar. I have just read this unbeleiveable post , if this stuff checks out it is truly shocking and thoroughly currupt. I also appreciate this sources politics (through my near zero American political knowledge) are likely to be biased, that however does not change the facts. "/>

      <outline text="Comment: The writer above is absolutely correct that, if we were prepared, the response to the aftermath of Katrina would be further along by now. Responsibility however is not with the administration, it lies with the electorate. We had a chance to make last year's election a referendum on the politics of terrorism, to seriously evaluate our preparedness, if we really cared. If anything is learned from this, we have to think, we can't delegate. We need leadership that cares, not in a superficial way. That leadership must come from us. We have some very huge decisions to make right now, and many thousands of lives depend on how well we do. That said, I have few ideas of things we can do other than give money to relief agencies, which of course, we are doing."/>

      <outline text="Speaking of things I just found, there's what appears to be an excellent conference in NYC on Monday about politics and blogging. It's so weird I'm just finding out about this. Sigh."/>
      <outline text="Afternoon coffee notes: Tomorrow I'm giving a talk at an academic conference in Pisa, Italy; from the beach in Florida. We did a dry-run of the video conferencing tools on Monday, they work great. It's also been suggested that I do a podcast of the talk I would have done at the Syndicate conference next week, and I think that's exactly the right way to route around an outage, in this case the lack of trust of a conference promoter. There's still important business to be done among the leading users of RSS. So I've had two jarring experiences with conferences this month. Maybe it has something to do with turning 50. Trying to make lemonade best I can. And looking forward to tomorrow's talk. Ironically the politics of the coastal United States are closer to that of Italy than they are of the deep south. Go figure. BTW, in an email from Glenn Reynolds he says the aftermath of the Respectful Disagreement discussion is not political. I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt and assume..."/>
      <outline text="I said I felt the same way he does. Given the incongruence of his appearance and his politics, and the fact that he had the self and mutual respect to be generous with a stranger in his hometown, told me there's a grace to conservatives that you would never see if you let the louts speak for all of them. If I were in his shoes, I would have done the same. Make sure that the guest knows that the loudmouths don't speak for everyone. Maybe then that would appear in the stranger's blog a few days after the conference."/>
      <outline text="I also met Nick Bradbury, a Nashville native, and developer of the FeedDemon feed reader. He's a soft-spoken, gentle, thoughtful man. Can't tell what his politics are, and I didn't ask, possibly because we come from such a politically charged technologic place, the world of RSS.  It's always good to have a face to put with a name. "/>
      <outline text="My host for the trip was Rex Hammock, who is a very nice guy, and probably a Republican, something I teased him about endlessly (don't worry he found something to tease me with too). He's an interesting guy, one of the few people with a blog who I seem to always agree with. Even so, he's the blogger who met with President Bush a couple of years ago. How could it be that I always agree with someone who would be invited to such a meeting? (To be clear, I would have accepted the invite myself, had it been offered, but the Republicans don't even allow people like myself to cover their national convention.) I think friendships like this, that are in themselves conundrums, are more important in some ways that friendships between people whose politics are identical. Between Rex and myself there's a clue, some value, a fundamental theorum, that's more important than whether you vote Democratic or Republican. "/>

At dinner last night, talking with Rebecca MacKinnon, Betsy Devine and Jenny Attiyeh (lucky Dave, three babes, one guy) about what we can take away from the conference, I said that we had our moments of civility, even affection, across the divide between the pros and the bloggers. But, I posited, the real accomplishment may be that now we better understand who we are, having had a chance to take the same side, even though we're so different. For example, I came to admire John Hinderaker, of Power Line, even though our politics are opposite. We have deeper values that bind us. Same with Jimmy Wales, the Wikipedia guy. Again, we're opposites in the way we create text but we're both advocates for the same idea, people doing it for themselves. In this context, Ed's story seems slightly profound. A blogger, on arriving safely at home, feels compelled to..."/>
      <outline text="Ed Cone is collecting an interesting series of essays for the conference. One mistake I've heard there, and several times on the conference mail list, is an assumption that blogs are all left or right. While, imho, all blogs are political, not all are about politics, and certainly not all about US politics. There are blogs by people from all kinds of places, geographic, intellectual and spiritual. This blog started about scripting (hence its title) and expanded to cover technology, and many other subjects. Yesterday on Zawodny's blog I commented that there is no &quot;the&quot; blogging community. So many people think they grok the wholeness of it, but are only looking at a small part.  Blogs go everywhere the Web goes, which is, today, everywhere."/>

The difference this time was that there was a Switzerland, me, to guide RSS through its gauntlet, and I clearly wasn't in bed with any of the major publishers or vendors.

      <outline text="This afternoon's first session was another ad! This time for Meetup.Com. I don't even want to know if they're a sponsor. I kept thinking if a reasonable moderator were here we'd ask if Meetup was the only example of this kind of stuff. Robert Putnam had some interesting things to say after the Meetup pitch. He talks about the 20th Century in different terms than I do, but observes the same phenomenon. Before the 20th Century we made our own entertainment, we entertained each other. Creativity was distributed. Along comes TV, radio, phonographs, CDs, mass produced print, and all of a sudden only the very best and most commercial of us are allowed to create. Now we're flipping back, because we can do mass distribution of micro-produced content. To the surprise and perhaps chagrin of the people on the last panel of the morning, this will flip around the equation in both business and politics. Demand will now tell supply what to make, instead of supply convincing demand to buy what they've..."/>

Micah Sifry, Britt Blaser and David Weinberger are in the row in front of me. Rebecca MacKinnon to the left. Keyboards clacking everywhere.

Now let's think about blogs on a local level. Based on the email I've been getting on this subject, it seems the time may be now. I want to lead a discussion on this at the I&amp;S conference at Harvard in December. And otherwise help evangelize the notion that we can route around the TV networks, and create the political system we want, from the one we were given. That's the gist of today's MCN.

I think the DNC also deserves credit for going first. I doubt if the RNC would have let Alan and his colleagues in if the DNC hadn't raised the bar. And finally, I was unable to apply to go to the RNC. They chose Alan presumably because his politics matched theirs. So right off the bat Alan your participation is tainted.

Dean's conjecture, even if it turns out to be wrong, is reasonable. The President lied about the connection between al Qaeda and Iraq in order to get us to go along with his war, there was no connection, it was obvious then, and totally obvious now. So if he lied to get us to pay billions to fight a war we didn't need to (if our goal was to fight terrorism, which we are told it is) well, why wouldn't he lie now? This is something the President should address, if he wants people to vote for him. At some point I hope even smart Republicans would want some kind of explanation about that. And Bush should also explain why al Qaeda is still in business, almost three years after the 9-11 disaster. How effectively has he used our military, our money, our ..."/>

      <outline text="Some announcements about BloggerCon II. We will have several sessions on journalism, politics and the campaign of 2004. We've scheduled the conference between the first part of the campaign, the primaries; and the next -- the conventions. The goal is to coalesce what we've learned in time to apply that knowledge in the second cycle. We will also have a session on weblogs and libraries, which is new. And if there's sufficient interest, we will repeat the sessions on medicine and law, and possibly add sessions for art, education, science and literature. Let me know. Based on the very strong response re visions for web writing tools, we will certainly have a session about that. We're also going to do a session on RSS. Technical people are welcome, but remember this is a user's conference. "/>

      <outline text="Dean said he needed centralized decision-making, and the bloggers pounce. I'd love to see a conference run with decentralized decision-making. I'm just an attendee. I get to decide who speaks. Why? Because decision-making is decentralized. Of course a campaign needs centralized decision-making. No question. But an election is a ouija board. The voters' decision is decentralized. Too many people believed the hype about Dean without thinking for themselves. Now you have to think. It wasn't a marvel of Internet technology, it was just an improvement, which ain't bad, but it's not a revolution. Here's the epitaph on Dean's of the Internet. It was 98 percent hype, two percent substance. The hype bought him an avalanche of free positive coverage in print, radio and television. The coverage, as usual, was bullshit. That was the juggernaut. Jim Moore, the insider, is the only analyst who has a story worth listening to. You're breathing each others fumes. Shame on you. So few people are thinkin..."/>
      <outline text="It's really gratifying to see Chris Lydon come down to earth re the Blogging of the Presidency meme he hitched his wagon to. Dean wasn't the savior, he was a candidate for president. But the people who stood up for Dean are revolutionaries. At best the Dean campaign was Netscape, inwardly focused, with a top-down map of the universe, with guess who at the top? This is the problem with looking to Presidential politics to be the venue for our salvation. Dean's choice was to start a new 25 percent party, or fire the Internet and try to stop Kerry. He chose the latter. That's fine. What about the rest of us? Find a local candidate who wants to win using the Internet, and as Picard said, make it so. "/>

      <outline text="Joe Trippi lost his job today. Dean hired Al Gore's former chief of staff, Roy Neel, to run the campaign. So we got our answer. Dean wants to catch Kerry, and the Internet will have to wait. The new manager is a long-time lobbyist, a &quot;special interest,&quot; influence seller, canonical insider. This is an okay outcome, not the best one, but okay. It's safe to support either Dean or Kerry, and we'll get a traditional Democrat administration either way. The CNN guys will treat him well now.

      <outline text="After watching the spin on CNN last night, and switching in and out of the more interesting MSNBC coverage, Chris Matthews was great, as were Bob Dole and Bob Woodward, here's my spin. If Dean is just like all the other candidates, there's nothing remarkable about his 25 percent of the NH vote. But, if instead of repping the entertainment industry as all Washington  Democrats have done so far, he actually considers Internet users to be a contituency, and watches out for our interests, then 25 percent is just awesome. It's on the map. If any minority got that kind of turnout all of a sudden you'd see a big shift in US politics. So let's watch Dean in the next few days. Now it's time to be creative with the much-mailigned Dean Corps. In the Iowa circus, that lasted months, okay people got tired of all the enthusiasm. But in a national campaign lasting a few weeks, use the advantage the Internet gives you. It's a word of mouth campaign."/>

      <outline text="I had lunch today with NYU journalism prof Jay Rosen and spoke at length with Chris Lydon about various ideas around academia, journalism, politics and weblogs. Noted that the term &quot;open source&quot; is being used to describe journalism and politics these days and wonder what exactly that means. In open source politics, a term which Joe Trippi uses to describe the Dean campaign, could I take a snapshot of their codebase (borrow the candidate) and fork the project? (Have him run for city council or dog catcher.) Or could I hijack the campaign, and take his place on stage, and introduce myself saying &quot;Hello I am Howard Dean.&quot; I'm all in favor of open politics, I think it's a must. But open is not the same as open source."/>

      <outline text="Speaking of presidential politics. Dean is the leader, but with the other candidates focusing on specific primaries, and the Dean campaign spread thin, and his lead not really all that great, it seems that the early primary season is going to be split, and maybe Dean won't win any of the contests? Was it enough to use the Internet to raise market-leading amounts of money? It didn't turn out to be enough in technology, why should it in politics? Imho, the Internet race will go to the candidate that unlocks the eBay-like secret to Web politics and keeps them coming back for more. Get out of the hub and spoke mode. No rock stars. Knock down barriers. Let's crack the blog hosting problem and figure out how to give everyone who wants one, no matter what their party, persuasion or political affiliation, a modern weblog with all the bells and whistles. Take a chance that all those voters may not choose your guy. What exactly do you have to lose? Will politics-as-usual get your guy elected?"/>

      <outline text="Several times, in different contexts at BC, I said that I don't care for the Dean weblog. I explained, when I go there I don't find anything that interests me. I see stuff that probably makes sense to people who support Dean but I'm not one of those people. I think the guy's an actor, and he tweaks a certain kind of person's optimism, but not mine. And get this, even if he did, after what I've seen in politics in my 48 years, and especially this year, I'm not believing anyone without a lot of questions answered in a way that add up for me. I think Dean's supporters, many of whom I admire, are selling out too soon and for too little. Dean is taking their money and giving it to Viacom, Disney, General Electric, Clear Channel, Fox and Time-Warner, just like all the rest. That's who owns him, not you. Now tell me something new on that blog, something honest, or even interesting, and I'll say so. But so far, zzzzz."/>
      <outline text="Now why should a non-techie care about this? Because it could happen again, in other areas, like politics and government. Howard Dean's campaign is just the beginning of what's possible when citizens take innovation in government into their own hands, the way we did in technology. Think what new formats and protocols would mean to politics and government. And today, I am just as committed to making that happen as I was committed in the mid-90s to have my freedom from the big technology companies. Mark my words, much more is possible than Dean's raising so much money on the Web. "/>

There's still a single owner of each category, and if that person wants to exclude something they can. This, emphatically, is not weblike. The directory I'm envisioning is one that's as open and chaotic as the Web itself. No one owns a category anymore than there is a single place to go for information on a single topic on the Web.

They had 2000 people working on this project, and they divided the tasks of developing various parts of the system, and the coordination (ie politics) betw the various organizations shows through in the design of the product. It's like a lot of company websites with confusing pointers at various levels of the site because different parts of the organization, at different times, had to get up some Web pages to protect their turf.

Of course Scripting News is linked in nowhere, but I didn''t expect it would be. (Also, they clearly didn''t seed any bloggers with the beta since it''s been open to the public for about 44 hours at this writing and there''s almost no coverage in the tech blog-o-s''fear.

      <outline text="More specifically it''s a blogosphere user''s conference. Tech companies may sponsor the show, but they are largely observers. When the discussion on stage is focused on blogs the people presenting often are users. And that''s the thing I like about Gnomedex. When you put vendors on stage, they have to get their money''s worth, it''s their job. I know because I''ve spoken at many conferences as a vendor. It''s always a struggle, the temptation to sell, balanced against the audience''s right to get value for their money." url="http://www.opmlsearch.com/OPMLTree.aspx?SourceURL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.scripting.com%2fopmlArchive%2f2007%2f08%2f21.opml&amp;outlineGuid=b2cc30a5-247c-4a81-a861-6d9df631b4f4" type="link"/>
      <outline text="Which brings me to another thing that''s fairly unique about Gnomedex. Most of the attendees pay to be there, unlike most tech conferences where almost no one pays. At Gnomedex, the tradition is so strong that even though I''ve spoken at two of the three shows I''ve been to, I''ve always paid for my ticket. It may be be out of personal loyalty to Chris and Ponzi, or knowing that it''s not a big corporation putting on the show, not sure what it is but it never occurs to me to ask for a comp.

      <outline text="This is a good thing, btw -- because its made it inappropriate for people to give commercials from the stage and kept the focus firmly on the users'' interests.

      <outline text="So maybe Facebook is filled with visionaries who want to build on the work of others, but I''m pretty sure there are also people there who would be happy to hold things back so they don''t have to work so hard. But don''t worry, they have them at Google, and Yahoo, and Microsoft and Apple too. It''s just the way things are done in the tech world.

      <outline text="Many people report (see above, and on TechCrunch) the Facebook feeds are not new. Maybe so, but... If they''re not new, their significance hasnÕt penetrated the thinking in the tech community. According to convention wisdom, Facebook was, until today, considered a sandbox, a walled garden, a silo. Now that we know that the feeds are being implemented (many are still needed to make it really open) it''s possible for Facebook-generated data to percolate into other Internet applications. As Fred Wilson has wisely pointed out, there is no winner-take-all outcome possible, and closed sandboxes just encourage route-arounds, so what Facebook is doing is smart and necessary. (Wilson is a backer of Twitter.)" url="http://www.opmlsearch.com/OPMLTree.aspx?SourceURL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.scripting.com%2fopmlArchive%2f2007%2f08%2f14.opml&amp;outlineGuid=f062ed29-7165-47f5-87d4-74b376210f6e" type="link"/>

      <outline text="1. As Fred Wilson points out in his post, it''s the polar opposite of the iPhone. He compares it to Ning, but it seems more like an early PC, and the app designer, if it delivers on its promise, as the BASIC that was bundled (in ROM) with those early machines. The assumption back then was that everyone would program for themselves. That of course led to the earliest users turning their personal labors of love into off-the-shelf products for other users. Hobbyists have always been at the core of the tech industry, it''s rare and refreshing to see people deliberately make a product for them.

While the engineers of the tech industry have been, imho, looking at the problem the wrong way by trying to glue together the huge namespaces controlled by powerful companies who don''t want to give up control. Twitter, with it''s ultra-thin user interface, and light feature set, and simple API (more on that in a bit) and the nothing-to-lose attitude of its management, may be the breakthrough. Or it could be Facebook, with it''s much larger user base and a management that also likes to roll the dice. The key is lots of users, a growing user base, and an API with no dead-ends.

There is a difference between tech and medicine. We have bubbles and they burst, and when that happens, we''re left to figure out what went wrong. It''s these crises that force us to confront the reality that there are other people here, that it''s not all about us. And that of course is on the path to becoming an adult.

Compare that against the nonsense that passes for tech news done by the pros. They put reporters on the stories who have no idea what they''re writing about, and you can tell. Or old school guys who only quote their friends, and haven''t found a new trend or product in years. All they know is that Apple, Google and Microsoft are important and that little companies are not.

      <outline text="Jeremy Allaire is also in my queue, and is verified immediately. What's the relationship? We were both early relatively successful web developers. We once, jointly, floated an interesting proposal for a tech standard that didn't go anywhere. I'm a founder of and pundit in a field that Allaire has started a company in (and raised a prodigious amount of money). He probably reads my blog. "/>
      <outline text="An over-covered story -- the professional reporters will go away, which is bad news for you and me. Not saying it isn't true, but how many times, and different ways have you read this story. But if Google were to fund the reporters, as the author suggests, what happens when Google's fortunes decline? Tech is a cyclic industry. What goes up must come down. Count on it. And who will watch Google? That's been the problem with the employees of big media companies, they never look at their funders. How do we know they're really losing money? Maybe they're controlled by politicians or business people who want to do nasty stuff without being observed? "/>

      <outline text="The Mac mini is exactly the kind of product Silicon Valley should never stop making. It's the perfect platform for tinkerers in the middle of the hottest growth area for tech, the home network. I keep mine under a 46-inch Sony HD-TV. Nothing else in Apple's product line would fit except Apple TV, which doesn't do enough to interest a guy like me. I want a new much faster Mac Mini, and would pay for it. It's the most cripped Mac I own, slow at everything. Yet its the workhorse of my home network. "/>
      <outline text="I totally disagree with my friend Robert Scoble who says that newspapers are dead. There's always been too much made of death in the tech world, in fact newspapers are still published, you can pick one up at any airport or train station. Many people have them delivered at home. We often go to newspaper websites for the news. Sure, there are problems, and the world is changing, but imho, we'll all do better if something called the San Francisco Chronicle continues to be published, even though the form of the newspaper will certainly change in the future. It would be a waste of a tradition, of a good coral reef, if newspapers really died. They need to change, and imho, when that change happens, we will safely be in the era of Web 3.0. "/>

      <outline text="Who loses when tech conferences lack integrity? I'd argue that the Valley loses. It's this kind of inbreeding that kept them from seeing what they call &quot;user generated content&quot; until 2004 or 2005, when it had been growing along with the web since its inception in the early 90s. An industry that prides itself on always being at the forefront had fallen far behind the leading edge. And even today, they don't understand it -- they call it &quot;new media&quot; -- and invite people who make them feel safe, they don't want to hear from people who challenge their assumptions. That's not a good way to design a conference, people come home feeling bored with the same-old same-old, when there are new experiences to be had, new ideas to be shared."/>

      <outline text="She had been at a conference on advertising in the new era, a panel discussion that included AlwaysOn publisher Tony Perkins and Kourosh Karimkhany from Wired Digital. The panel turned to the discussion that was brewing in our corner of the blogosphere about the role of sources and our relationship to reporters. "/>
      <outline text="2. On the other side, I did a classic phone interview with a SF Chronicle reporter a week or so ago, shortly after the Virginia Tech massacre, to talk about the releasing of the videos from NBC. I wanted to discuss this with a news reporter, who I felt might have an opinion about it, who would likely want to view the videos himself, rather than have them filtered for him by a competitor. I wasn't disappointed. "/>
      <outline text="I know the pressures people operate under, I ran four conferences myself, and never took money for a speaking slot. But it's common practice in the tech industry. And I'm glad that Jason and Mike are going to make an issue of it, because it will put pressure on other conferences to clean up their act. There will be a lot more disclosing in the future, and maybe some conferences will have to find a new business model to keep people coming."/>
      <outline text="I think I'm one of the people who Jim Forbes was on a first-name basis with when I used to run a software company in the valley, and he was a reporter for various tech pubs. "/>
      <outline text="Dan Gillmor says he votes by changing the channel, but that doesn't work when all the networks are covering the same idiotic press conference, where the DNA results of the paternity test for Anna Nicole's baby are being announced, or on the first day back at Virginia Tech when they're holding yet another prayer vigil with orange and maroon balloons. I think it would be nice if they had such ceremonies without the network cameras there, and of course I turn off the TV when they all do that, but see the previous item about Iraq, there is actually news going on when they go into 24-hour hand-wringing mode, and TV is a good way to get news, if only you could get some. "/>
      <outline text="I was drinking coffee, watching the morning news when a story about Virginia Tech came on MSNBC. I really wanted to begin this week without more stories about how they're coping. I know this makes me an ogre, but after listening to On The Media yesterday, my cynicism is validated. And after watching 60 Minutes about life in Baghdad, the first report I've seen to actually go in to get the story, I was aware that people are dying in places outside Blacksburg (and truthfully, the dying is probably over in Blacksburg). "/>
      <outline text="I had a flash, I want a checkbox that tells MSNBC that I don't want any more Virginia Tech stories."/>
      <outline text="I think this is another form of the River of News, the checkboxes represent subscriptions. I could see MSNBC including stories produced by CNN, and sharing revenue with them. The goal is to get the best news experience tailored to the interests of specific users. I don't want to interfere with people who want to see the Virginia Tech students go back to class, but I want to move on, and want my news provider to respect that. (And I still want the choice to see Cho's videos, I think that was the solution to the problems Howie Kurtz was concerned with on the Reliable Sources. Note that media navel-gazing is not checked in my customized view. This permits them to talk about themselves all they want, which is fine with me.)"/>

      <outline text="When it came out yesterday that Cho, the Virginia Tech killer, had sent 23 QuickTime videos to NBC in NY, that changed forever how I thought about blogging, video, podcasting, etc. When I first put up the post, Steve Garfield sent an email saying he didn't think it was vlogging, but I'm not so sure. Whatever it is, there's an amateur using the new tools, not for good, but horribly, for bad. "/>

      <outline text="I've heard it said we're exploiting other people's pain. I suppose almost any event could be spun that way. For example, when the President says we should wait six months before judging his troop surge, a lot of people are going to die because of that, and anyone who is critical of his plan might be seen as exploiting their pain. It's in times of crisis like this that we learn the most about our values and how they compare to others. A lot of learning happens. There are always people calling foul, so be it. (People used to say who was I to write about tech, then they said I shouldn't write about politics. I said don't read it if you don't like it.)"/>

Why are the lives of the Virginia Tech students any more precious than the lives of our soldiers in Iraq, and please explain to me why they're more precious than the lives of Iraqi children, some much younger and more helpless than the Virginia students. They aren't. A life is a life, all are equal. And as Olbermann pointed out, the deaths in Iraq are more preventable than those from a random act of violence."/>

      <outline text="I'm not aware of any tech blogger who has received a serious threat of a defamation suit, but I'm sure there have been some.

The method of retraction they call for seems to reflect a print reality, not an electronic one."/>

      <outline text="In 1983 I wanted to develop for the Mac and I had investors advising me, older guys who had been in the tech business probably about as long as I've been in it now. Everyone said that Apple was dead. They asked what Apple's sales were. About a billion dollars. They said it was safe to develop for them, because billion dollar companies don't go away. Same with Microsoft today."/>
      <outline text="What's happening with MS is not death, but being pulled back to earth by gravity. It's the cycle of tech companies, and it's like the cycle of world powers. You have a vast natural resource to exploit, your population grows, the air gets clogged, the resource starts to run out and you're left with a large population. You go from optimism and huge growth to reality and flat, even negative growth. It's completely natural and predictable. It's going to happen to Google too, bet on it."/>

      <outline text="My own two cents, when thinking about declining tech markets, something I've seen four or five times -- when a boom is tailing off is the best time to invest in truly new ideas. People's thinking has been going in one direction for a long time, so long that all the big or obvious ideas have been tried, many times, and people are creatively exhausted. It's a good time to change your assumptions, head off in a different direction. Everyone's been zigging, so now it's time to zag."/>
      <outline text="Those who provided the riot Ms Sierra asked for, unknowingly, I'm sure, attacked at least one person whose health is pretty fragile. I wonder how y'all feel now that you know that. I wonder how you'd feel if that person died in the midst of the shitstorm. Someday if we don't change the herd mentality of the tech blogosphere, that is likely to happen. I don't want to be part of the herd on that day, that's why I won't join herds. "/>
      <outline text="Like so many others in the tech blogging world, I've spent the last few weeks exploring Twitter. I understand that there were lots of people using it before me, and before that, the developers of Twitter envisioned something that all the rest of us didn't. So before going any further, let's pause for a moment and appreciate their innovation and contribution to the richness of the cyber-environment that we work in. Congrats on a great accomplishment."/>
      <outline text="InfoWorld was the first tech publication that gave you sweaty palms when it arrived in the mail. This was before the web, so news came in weekly installments. When InfoWorld arrived, everything else stopped. I read it from cover to cover. "/>
      <outline text="Of course you run ads on each of the pages, that's your reward for sharing your authority with the people who used to be your sources (and who still are, in every sense). Now your reporters just have to read the blogs to find the new trends, the quotes for their articles. They will learn a lot and perhaps even start having fun, instead of (as Markoff puts it in the O'Reilly piece) feeling like they're at a wake. That's depression, and you can feel it in the articles they write, and you can't possibly dig out of a hole when you're depressed. You need to find a way to tap into the excitement of the Internet, to bring it into your publication. In the tech business they call this &quot;embrace and extend.&quot;"/>

      <outline text="His book, while based on an important and valuable premise, that Silicon Valley is too-much admired for the good of all of us, including the tech industry, fails to enlighten while he props up the egos of obsolete people and businesses.

I was ready for a work that would inspire a thoughtful response, because I like Andrew, at a personal level, but this book is beneath criticism. Back to the drawing board. "/>

      <outline text="A lot of the analysis of Gartenberg's move has been about how he might influence us, but to me that's the blogosphere not understanding its own importance. The true measure of his effectiveness is how much we influence them. Remember this is the world after the audience. If you add up the smarts in their room and the smarts in our room, we win, because there are so many more of us than there are of them, even though Microsoft is a very large company. Their challenge has always been to find a way to harness our power, to make them smarter. When Microsoft has achieved its mission it's been because they did this better than anyone else. Of all the tech companies this is their area of strength, more than Apple, more than Google, Microsoft is of the people, not such an ivory tower, although in recent years, it's looking and acting more like all the other tech companies."/>

      <outline text="Find the CP/M of the Internet. It's gotta be ugly and geek-friendly. A piece of software with a command-line that today's 12 year old nerd could add something to that would make everyone's life more fun, and give us something to do with the Internet that you could never sell inside a large tech organization like Microsoft or Google. Something like Visicalc, dBASE, 1-2-3 or Wordstar. MacPaint, MacWrite, Pagemaker or Flight Simulator. Tetris, PacMan, MySpace &amp; Napster. "/>
      <outline text="And you gotta ask yourself when it's going to completely flip over, when a reporter that grants embargos to big tech companies like Apple or Microsoft is going to have to explain why they never run bad news about these companies. That's an even bigger scandal, imho, than the option backdating one. Me, I'm proud that I'm not invited to Apple or Microsoft events, as long as they're running such ethically compromised PR. And yes, I believe there is an ethics to PR, it's the mirror image of the ethics of reporters. Vendors must respect that reporters must write what they believe, not what the companies want them to write. That I'm not invited is how you know that I haven't compromised. Can't say the same for other bloggers, however. Lots of people dipping into the same poisoned well that the MSM guys did."/>

      <outline text="Paul Boutin notes that everything Apple announced is in vapor, and that's new for Apple (and disappointing for users), but all CES previews are vapor and Apple is, in every way, a consumer electronics vendor now. &quot;By holding his own mini-CES 500 miles away, Jobs literally stole the show. As I sit here typing in a sulk, an NPR stringer in Vegas just messaged, 'CES is dead because iphone is all that mattered today. there is a mood of -- like everyone here went to the wrong party.'&quot;"/>
      <outline text="Fascinating report on the internal view of developers at Microsoft, circa 1996. I knew James Plamondon, he was one of the good guys, relatively speaking. I overheard a worse conversation on a bus at Microsoft in the same period, and wrote it up in a DaveNet story. Of course this didn't win me many friends at Microsoft, but it cemented my relationship with the few people who worked there then who really wanted to do great stuff, which imho, we went on to do. Today, the bad people at Microsoft won, bigtime, leaving them as mediocre as any tech company you can think of. Apple, a much smaller company, is completely, utterly, kicking their ass. Which would be even more gratifying if Apple had a culture of supporting, even celebrating developers. "/>

      <outline text="Google and Apple, two other companies Sean mentions, have filed similar patents. Of course what they did wasn't right or fair, but also, neither of them claimed to be helping the community as Microsoft did, and neither has been convicted of antitrust as Microsoft has. Even so, I have been critical of both Apple and Google here, for their efforts to corral RSS behind a wall of corporate ownership. In contrast, I don't think any of the big publishing companies, notably the New York Times Company, who have made a greater and much earlier contribution to the success of RSS than the tech industry has, have tried to own it or fork it as Google, Apple and Microsoft have. There's a lesson here, and Sean is a good teacher. Yes Sean, the tech industry is bad. But even in the tech industry, Microsoft stands head and shoulders above the rest. And yes it has been common practice in the tech industry for companies to blackmail each other, to the detriment of users and the market, but that doesn't ma..."/>
      <outline text="This is how the business press lost its credibility, and it's why the tech blogosphere was founded in the first place, to route around their conflicts. It's not just advertising that makes them attack, it's also that they need to get a certain number of phone calls returned by Microsoft people to do their jobs, and if they don't smack me for saying Microsoft did bad, they may return the other pubs calls, not theirs. "/>
      <outline text="Fast-forward to 2006, after a lot of time was put in by a lot of people to get a teeny little bit of interop here and there, and predictably, it's being erased, of course, by the tech industry. I don't think there's any doubt about it. This just happens to be the week I took a look. I don't know why. Maybe I was bored. Maybe it was meant to be. "/>

      <outline text="I read on Frank Shaw's blog that Nick Denton thinks that embargoes will soon be a thing of the past. I think this is a good thing, even though I fully understand why big companies like Microsoft (Shaw's client) have attempted to orchestrate product rollouts in the past. It made more sense before there were blogs, when the number of news outlets was finite, and when most people were dependent on intermediaries to find out about new products. That hasn't been true for quite some time, and it will be less true in the future. "/>
      <outline text="Remember the press room thing I wanted to do, why don't we organize one for big tech companies and the same kinds of bloggers that went to Microsoft's thing, except the bloggers pay their own way and the companies pay us to get 1/2 hour to present and then a few of their people can mingle throughout the day. We buy food, wifi, a big hotel suite (or small ballroom), level the playing field and let the ideas flow without worrying so much about social behavior. I figure we could do a first class job for about $25K for a day."/>

      <outline text="A question you can't easily ask the Internet today. &quot;Where can I buy firewood as a function of price and distance from where I am now?&quot; I invested in Confabb because it's that kind of no-nonsense obviously useful idea that the tech industry so often overlooks. Another one that I'd invest in, in an instant: An easy accounting system for small business or home users. I want to be able to pay bills (already can do this at my bank), and categorize the expenses, and have the same data available through the web, to my accountant. Same with income. When I describe this, people say &quot;Quicken.&quot; But geez come on, it's not web based and it's not easy. I want to be able to enter an expense no matter where I am. That's the secret for detail-averse people like myself, make it painless. "/>

      <outline text="Valleywag, with a new writer, Gawker publisher Nick Denton, while missing some of the stalkiness (I know it's not a word) of the previous version (like the bathroom habits of tech industry icons), is starting to provide some hard, useful data that helps fill in some of the blanks. Over the last few days we've gotten some fresh data about Google's acquisition of Blogger, almost three years ago. And it's starting to have an opinion about things that matter. Not sure if this is intentional, or if Nick wants appreciation, but no matter, I appreciate what he's doing. "/>
      <outline text="Something else Valleywag is now doing right -- disclosing conflicts of interest. It always bothered me when they went after Jason Calacanis, whose Weblogs, Inc is a direct competitor of Gawker Media. They would never disclose that fact. In this piece they do. "/>

Markoff, theoretically the top technology journalist in the world, and O'Reilly who many believe publishes the best howto and reference books (I'm among them) seem to think somehow this BS matters! I know why O'Reilly wants to perpetuate the myth that anyone understands wtf Web 2.0 is, but why would Markoff and his NY Times bosses want to get into this fray? If you have a clue, please post a comment. "/>
      <outline text="This is fairly conspicuous in Markoff's reporting in the Times. Does he ever write an article, on any subject, that doesn't quote Danny Hillis? Maybe there was some justification for allocating him so much ink when he was a tech exec at Disney, but what has he done recently to give authority to his opinion? (And what was the value of the technology he left behind, didn't Disney buy Pixar because their technology was so far behind?)"/>

I spoke at his conference in May, along with Dan Gillmor. I am now on the Advisory Board of SNS, and at our meeting last week in Seattle, I urged Mark and his team to start a weblog, and now they have done so.

      <outline text="&quot;A coworker's daughter had one with this problem.  She had it sent in before she started college, but it happened again once she got to college.  After a lot of stress and pushing Apple, they resolved it, by trading it up for a Mac Book Pro.  So they spent more money, but they did get $200 off for having to do this. I guess the Apple tech person said they probably didn't want to bother risking it continuing.  Not a pretty picture for those it afflicts."/>

      <outline text="The next step in the evolution of mobile rivers is a way for a feed to link to articles that render well on mobile devices. I don't want to propose a specific way of doing that, I could, but then the argument would be why I think I have the right to do that, which is an old boring argument that I'd rather side-step. Rather, I'm going to ask the great minds of the tech blogosphere to mull this over, discuss it if you like, and propose some solutions. Even better if you are a source of content, and can vouch for a bunch of feeds that will support your proposed solution. Then we can seek a second party and a third to support the first workable solution that pops up."/>
      <outline text="First, consider the BBC and NY Times rivers. When I link to an article, I start with the URL to the &quot;rich&quot; HTML rendering, and apply an algorithm to turn the rich URL into a URL that points to a &quot;plain jane&quot; page, one which renders well on a mobile device. For example, here's an article on the BBC website, and here's the mobile-friendly version. See the difference? On a desktop or laptop, you'd probably prefer the rich version, but on a mobile device, like my Blackberry, the plain version works much better."/>
      <outline text="This press release is the first I heard that the EFF (apparently) would like to speak for podcasters. Watch out for the EFF, they tend to sell us out for the tech industry, an industry that has major conflicts with people and organizations that create content. When asked to help us out with Google their answer was &quot;tough shit.&quot; Hey they could have at least engaged in respectful discourse, but they clearly didn't care what we think. I was pretty sure they'd eventually care. Now they do, and they're trying to gloss over the fact that they haven't got our support. I suppose Cory Doctorow speaks for some podcasters, but he sure doesn't speak for me. Evan Williams? Does he do podcasts?"/>

Want more women speakers at tech conferences? Okay, have a tech conference, and make that one of your goals, perhaps your primary goal. You have to do it. There are no shortcuts. "/>

Added bonus, no pictures. Next party will have to be in Moscone, and they'll call it a trade show. Watch out for parties where the beer and wine are free and the lines at the bar are short.

Want everyone's ideas about what we should be doing. Such as access to information that's hidden in plain view. e.g. financial disclosures on paper. Have to wade through 535 .pdfs. Are digitizing these to make them searchable. can't get in a unified way contracts and other layouts. that will be up in a month too. What other kinds of content would people like to have at their fingertips? Want help in building the apis for mashing things up. Sunlight labs is working on tools tohelp bloggers and CJs do what they do. The pop-up politician, for example. If yoiu mention a representative, mouseover and a pic of the person pops up, and links out to various databases are there. make stuff available where people are looking rather than forcing the reader to look everywhere. We are deliberately a half-baked operation."/>

      <outline text="The sparks start to fly over at Frank Paynter's. Hard to find a quote to pull, but he's saying publicly what a lot of people were saying privately, or in a veiled way (see below). Mena Trott is a former competitor of mine, so I avoided saying things specifically about her pitches, but I imagine Matt Mullenweg, who was in the audience at the time, might have felt it was unfair for her to sell TypePad, when his product is equally commendable. This is very common in tech conferences, and one of the best reasons to keep product pitches off the stage."/>
      <outline text="The commercialism that bothered some wasn't in my way. That's not to say that they shouldn't tone it down next time, they should. Sponsors should not be on stage giving pitches. It sets the wrong tone, and excuses speakers for doing the same. I was embarassed for some of the speakers who did the usual thing, told stories to set up product pitches. That leaves you with a slimy feeling, mostly about them at a conference like this, where the idealism was the current driving the people. At tech events it's different, where cynicism is the undercurrent. "/>

      <outline text="There's been a longish email thread going back and forth after Ryan Montoya's appearance on The Gillmor Gang, recorded on Saturday during lunch at Gnomedex. Even before the show I felt sorry for Montoya, Senator Edwards's tech advisor. He's a really nice guy, and I'm sure he means well. Now he's been vetted on our mashup of The Gong Show and Captain Kangaroo. Anyway, in the thread we're trying to pump Ryan up with ideas for how The Senator could make effective use of the Internet, mostly BS about the Senator and his wife blogging, or putting a webcam in their bedroom. I came up with something different, it's what I would do if I were trying to premeditate an Internet phenomenon in 2008, akin to the Dean Campaign of 2003. So here's the text of the email which I sent to Montoya and cc'd to Doc Searls, Dan Farber, Steve Gillmor, Robert Scoble and Mike Arrington. "/>

      <outline text="This comment from Flickr creator Stewart Butterfield shows clearly why we need a user's conference to resolve these issues, because, like all other tech vendors, he's only focusing on his competitor, Zooomr and ignoring the interests of his customers. Yes, I know Flickr has an export function, but by making it harder than it has to be, you're holding on to something you have no right to hold on to. "/>
      <outline text="I'm frazzled. I've got lots to post though, and I've got to make a nice big irate call to Apple Tech Support sometime, as I'm pretty effing pissed at my Mac."/>
      <outline text="Every bookshop I visited during my recent stay in the States contained numerous &quot;tech vision&quot; books. Almost every person I'd think of as a tech visionary is an American, with only a handful of exceptions. Think how this has played out. I mean, name some web startups from either Web 1.0 or 2.0. Google, eBay, Amazon, del.icio.us and Flickr. Add a pile of fifty or a hundred more on there. It makes no difference. I can nearly guarantee you that however many names you throw out there, you won't get in to double digits counting London-based startups. If you said Freeserve, lastminute.com and boo.com, congratulations. Look in to those three, and you'll see exactly the subtext of the whole debate. What we want - creative, technological startups - just doesn't exist here. Across the Irish sea, things seem to be happening, as James and company will attest. But here, we're dead."/>

      <outline text="I had my phone talk this morning with Lisa Williams, who will lead the Emotional Life discussion on Friday at BloggerCon IV. It'll be the third instance, the first was led by John Perry Barlow, the second by Julie Leung. The idea is simple, blogs aren't just about tech or politics or business, sometimes they're about people, and sometimes they play a big role in helping us get through difficult times. Sometimes it's real simple, here are the lives we lead and how they relate to others. Sometimes the truth is so close to the surface, there can be no masks, who we are comes out through our online persona. This is the riskiest topic we tackle, it's the double-diamond slope of BloggerCon, but it's also potentially the most rewarding. "/>

      <outline text="I don't agree with the statement about intellectual property, but George Osborne is picking up the message that everyone I talk to seems to be clear about - that there are no British tech startups. We should attempt to recreate the entrepreneurship of Silicon Valley, but we don't want to try to recreate the US Patent and Trademark Office. We don't want the British system handing out patents for peanut and jelly sandwiches or the free energy machines which the Americans tend to have."/>

      <outline text="Thanks for all the links to the FeedBurner piece below. I've been thinking about this for quite some time, and talking about the idea with as many people as will listen. I think it's important because it cuts to the core of how important identity is, and how simple it can be. I also think it foretells of what the users are going to be demanding of the vendors pretty soon, so if you're a tech investor, you should pay attention. There's definitely money to be made here, but there's a fair way to do it, and that also, imho, will turn out to be the correct business approach."/>

I've got Synergy set up so I can use one mouse and keyboard to control up to three operating systems across up to three monitors (or four at a push, but it's something I try to avoid). I can't keep track of what OS I'm running. But, unlike Calacanis, I don't have to chat with Valleywag about a possible move to Google or about my cool monitors (I was dual-heading before it was cool).

      <outline text="There has been a lot of discussion in the last couple of days about podcasting, and whether it has achieved its promise, or if it will achieve its promise. We all have different perspectives, but if you think about what it looks like from the point of view of someone who was reading this weblog in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005, there was unbelievably huge growth in podcasting in 2005 and the first part of 2006. Think about all the experiments we did here in the early years, and how they didn't start getting uptake until mid-2004 or so. If one percent of the people in the US are using podcasts today, that's 3 million people. That's a lot more people than read this blog. So something is working!"/>
      <outline text="Kent Newsome thinks we are going through a dry spell as tech bloggers. This is something I'm more or less resistant too, being primarily a link blogger, and covering both political, philosophical and the traditional technological stuff."/>
      <outline text="What is causing my blogging blues? That all the good ideas that we are coming up with seem to be amounting to nowt. The tech industry isn't telling the entertainment companies what they're good for (basically, nothing). All the stuff which we get excited about (syndication, outliners, podcasting, open formats, open source) isn't filtering down to the people who need it as quickly as the bullshit from the corporations is."/>
      <outline text="Not sure what to make of Apple's new beta Boot Camp tool that lets you install Windows on the Intel Macs. I've read most of the commentary on it, and I don't see too many other people really excited about it. If they let you run Windows apps alongside Mac apps, I could see buying a Mac laptop to run Windows software, otherwise you can get a better deal from Dell, IBM or Sony. I don't like the Apple hype about this, where they sell against malware aimed at Windows users. Someday they're going to be fighting that battle too, and it's really poor taste to market to victims users that way. But I've never really liked Apple's arrogance, even though I use Macs, today."/>

      <outline text="I've been following the mixup over Scoble's meeting at Amazon, from a distance. The guy from Amazon apparently asked Scoble to cut the bullshit and tell him why he should be interested in blogs. If I had been there I would have said that blogging is now an expected channel of communication with at least some customers, with developers and the press. Amazon has customers, and presumably wants more. And they have a developer pitch too, and they have stories they want to communicate to the press. So if some of the people you want to reach like to receive information via RSS and blogs, why would you not want to provide it? To me, asking why you should use blogs is like asking why you should answer the phone. It might be a customer, a developer who wants to use your services, or a reporter who wants to write about the company. Your competitors answer the phone, so you should too. "/>

      <outline text="The top stories on Memeorandum this week have been the delay in Windows Vista and the reorg in OS development at Microsoft. Their web conference in Las Vegas didn't make much of an impression in the blogosphere. My guess is that they just went with safe bloggers, and if you go for safety you might as well not do it at all. Now, if they had come to us and said, what could you do with the resources we're going to put behind this conference, could we have created some lasting value? Without a doubt. How many millions of dollars did they spend on Mix 06? I'd have gone looking for a college classroom building we could use during spring break, and put participants up in Motel 6, Best Western and Hampton Inn (and pay their airfare and incidentals). One space for podcasting. One for blogging. One for APIs. And so on. Add 1/3 Microsoft people so they can absorb the culture. And do a hack-a-thon, something that's definitely part of MS culture (they were doing them as far back as the 80s). But to..."/>

One idea I should have mentioned but didn't, is probably the most valuable and least glamorous. A web-based accounting app for families. Such a simple idea and so totally needed by many millions of people. Quicken is getting old, and it's hard to set up and it isn't accessible over the web. When that's done, do one for small business. Along the way either get acquired by or acquire a bank to make it even easier for your users. "/>

That could be good. I did post a comment to Nick Carr's award-winning post explaining that of course Jeff Jarvis does get it, despite the snark, and I hope that isn't over-looked in all the good-natured Sunday morning poking.

      <outline text="A brilliant and insightful piece about RSS from Dion Hinchcliffe. Last week I was emailing with an architect at one of the major enterprise software companies, a huge company with offices all over the world. She told me that RSS 2.0 has become the framework for all their work now, completely replacing J2EE. She wondered if that was my plan. I said it wasn't -- that was what SOAP was supposed to do. But SOAP got all screwed up by exactly the kind of tech BS that's starting to happen now with RSS. It's probably too late for the tech companies to screw it up, RSS 2.0 has too much momentum and too many people are happy with what it does, and the Roadmap provides an adequate escape valve for the pressure to innovate. But we need to keep our eyes and ears open. Given the chance, Silicon Valley and Redmond will definitely screw it up. "/>
      <outline text="Here's an illustration of tech industry interference with RSS. That's Sam Ruby, the lead of the Atom working group, an employee of IBM, trying to rewrite the rules of RSS 2.0. Do you understand what he's saying? I don't. Assuming he means well, which I think is a stretch (he's got a huge conflict of interest) he surely doesn't understand the phillosophy of RSS 2.0. Does management at IBM know he's doing this, is this part of a strategy to keep their lock on the enterprise software business, which RSS clearly is a threat to? Like Sam, they have a conflict of interest too. In the tech world, I've learned that if you think the worst of people's motives you're usually right. IBM doesn't generally go for the high road. In any case, IBM should call him off, now. Atom is fine, let people use that if they want, but if you screw with RSS, we're going to shine the light on you."/>

      <outline text="In public when a star acts like a person, the fan can become quite abusive, I know I've seen it with my own eyes. And these days they have their own publications (blogs, duh) so their opinions are heard much more widely. I didn't realize this until very recently, on returning to the Bay Area, where my celebrity is at its maximum, that's why I've come to dislike public tech events more and more over time, and go to fewer. I'd like to be treated like a person, I really don't like being a celebrity, I am not an actor. "/>

No copy-paste. Nothing complicated. If we wanted we could have made the url invisible, but we decided that would be too confusing. Now what's the general solution that works for everyone all the time? This is one of those times when, if Microsoft, Apple and Linux could get together, they could upgrade the Internet in a nice way. Probably just Microsoft alone could do it (the others would have to follow). Choose a port which is the Subscription Manager port. Say it's 5350, a random unassigned port. Then when you want to say &quot;click here to subscribe to this website&quot; include a link that looks like this.

It requires a little digging to find all the goodies, but the payoff is huge because the BBC has so much you can subscribe to. Now there's a way to find it from the BBC site."/>

      <outline text="Zawodny, who works at Yahoo and ought to know, says it's a bug. That reminds me of a story someone told on stage at Esther Dyson's conference in the heyday of Lotus 1-2-3. He imagined -- what if, at random, Lotus version 5.0 magically appeared on his computer one day. It's just a pattern of bits, it's improbable, for sure, but it could happen. Think of all the millions of dollars that he would have made, and all the millions that Lotus would have lost. So fast-forward to 2004, Yahoo has a bug that somehow makes it appear as if they have a built-in RSS aggregator. Hmmm. I suppose stranger things have happened? "/>

      <outline text="Now the paid-for speaking slots thing happens all the time, everywhere you go, it's the norm in tech conferences. It may be the norm for all conferences, since I don't go to many conferences anymore, largely because of this. And a lot of other people are staying home too, which feeds a spiral of commercialism, because now that fewer people are paying the conference fees, the promoters rely more heavily on sponsorship, so the conferences become more commercial, so more people stay home, and on and on."/>
      <outline text="Tech companies seem to feel it's their god-given right to make money at every venue, even when they don't pay for it, apparently. Well, I held the line at BloggerCon, and by the time we got to the third one, we got the sponsorship money without having to take it up the butt. This was because I had a very tough rule about commercialism, even tougher than Harvard required. I really don't like commercials to creep into conferences that are focused on the people, not the companies. Imho, it spoils the fun."/>

We've developed and continue to develop new ways to refine information using the tools of the Web. That's why (I think) librarians are so excited about weblogs, RSS and the Web in general. But we should listen carefully when they caution that the Web has not yet caught up with the pre-Web practice. "/>

      <outline text="Matthew Ingram: &quot;I'm not sure anyone should listen to how he wants to 'reform' the venture capital business.&quot; I've heard this before. Once David Weinberger and Howard Rheingold told me that people wouldn't listen to my ideas on anything other than technical issues. I tried to explain that those kinds of barriers are exactly why I started blogging, because good ideas can come from users, and from people who receive investments, not just from people who make them. It's that kind of thinking that the Internet is so good at routing around. Of course the intermediaries don't think I have the qualifications to talk about VC or friendship, but the fact is I am a technology investor, and I've done fairly well at it. I'd love to know how much money Matthew Ingram has bet and what his track record is on tech investments. I've won some, lost some, but so far I'm solidly in the black. Over the years I've gotten a return that any VC would be delighted with. So, even if you only want to hear from pe..."/>

      <outline text="Memeorandum just discovered the game-changers piece, written two days ago. It's old news, new to MOR. Update: Now it thinks Fred Wilson's piece is the top level one, even though it's essentially a link to my original piece, and then later, my piece is gone altogether, it's as if the idea came from Fred. Oy. I bet that was caused by my pointing to his piece. I think MOR has me typecast as a maker-of-links not one to-be-linked-to. If so, it's time for a reboot, Gabe. I write lots of original stuff. Almost every day something new. "/>
      <outline text="Anne 2.0 writes great stuff, and today gets to some core questions about reading lists and OPML. A reading list is more than a compendium, I think it's got to be curated the way an art director chooses paintings for an art exhibit (as if I knew how they do that). As a reader, I want the effect to be subtle. All of a sudden I'm getting much better info about gadgets, even pointing to stuff from those sources. But I'd never have thought to subscribe to the feeds. Luckily I know an expert in gadgets and he did a reading list for people like me, people who dabble, who enjoy gadgetry, but haven't committed much time to the subject. So while it's great that you have an OPML of women in technology (it would make a fantastic directory) it probably isn't a great reading list. But what do I know. This is all so new. Keep on writing and I'll keep reading (and commenting)."/>
      <outline text="BTW, the last time I ran that pic of Esther Dyson (adjacent to the post above) she sent an email asking (very nicely) what it meant. I said it's just a decoration, I liked the picture, and I like to put interesting pictures in long posts to stir the imagination, as a kind of art. A few days ago a picture of briefcase or file folder with that picture on it either appeared in a dream or in my FlickrRivr stream (I honestly don't remember) and ever since I've been looking for a way to get it into my Scripting News stream. So anticipating Esther's curiousity, that's why it's there today. Hope you're having a great time representing the Tech Nation at Davos! &quot;;-&gt;&quot;"/>

The techies have tried to muddy it up, pointing out all the competing ideas that came from all kinds of different directions, but the fact remains that the RSS we use today, the one that rose to the top, was the one that the publishing industry got behind. It's cool that Sean came out in public on this because he is from the most tech of tech companies, Microsoft. &quot;The best thing that we in the tech industry can do is recognize and take to heart exactly why RSS is successful and do everything in our power to make sure that we don't mess with that.&quot; Now, I'd love to hear what Apple has to say in response.

      <outline text="An important point not to miss: weblogs are publications. Bloggers are therefore publishers. Any innovation that comes from blogs comes from publishing. The reason the distinction is important is that publishers have a fundamentally different view of the world than tech companies. I'm still working on trying to characterize it. One thing is for sure, the tech industry takes a dim view of this kind of thinking. Why? They look at publishing as &quot;user generated content&quot; and authors as &quot;the long tail&quot; (with them as the head of course). They see themselves as the makers of the money, and us as the laborers of love. That for sure is a flawed way of viewing the world, defintely a loop the tech industry is in, one that the publishing industry should not continue to support. "/>

      <outline text="Example: Manchester The city of Manchester is the regional capital and commercial, educational, medical and cultural centre of England's North West region, the second largest economic region in the United Kingdom (UK) after London. The city has a population of about 440 thousand people, and the metropolitan sub-region (Greater Manchester) has more than 2.5 million inhabitants (year 2000). The knowledge base of the Manchester region is considered to be very good. There are four universities and several other high-performing education institutions. These HEIs have differing specialities: varying from science to a vocational focus. Due to a reduction in the availability of decreasing public funds, the HEIs are starting to adopt a more market-oriented approach, which is desirable for a city that wants to stimulate stronger relationships between knowledge institutions, businesses and local communities.

      <outline text="Regeneration initiatives, for example in the city centre, Hulme and East Manchester, have contributed to the development of a more attractive city and a better image. Now, the city centre functions as a magnet for young urban professionals. Connectivity and accessibility are considered to be essential for attracting knowledge activities. These aspects of Manchester are judged as being good, but some elements could be improved. The growing international airport ensures the international connectivity and greatly enhances the attractiveness of the region as a location for business and investment. Manchester also has a rich urban diversity. The large variety within the built-up area, the urban activities and the inhabitants helps to make the urban region attractive in the knowledge economy.

      <outline text="Kevin, if we had left RSS to the technology industry, it would be like Apple's version of RSS, except there would be 12 dozen of them, and none of them would interop. Instead, the consensus developed around the RSS that the New York Times used, and last time I checked they were in publishing, not technology. But there's an interesting question buried one level deeper, is the publishing industry the new technology industry? Are they doing better technology than the old technology industry? In the case of RSS, there's absolutely no doubt -- they are. Yahoo and Microsoft are following them, and that's the smartest thing any tech company can do. Google thinks they're the tail wagging the dog, but they may figure out that fighting the consensus isn't in their interest. Kevin himself once was a consensus-fighter, but wisely now has seen that his interest is in making users happy, not in undermining their will.

My Mac is slow as a dog, even though it has two CPUs and cost $5000, but I use it anyway because it's prettier and slightly more fun than the crap Microsoft and Dell ship. But give me a reason to switch, even a small one, and I'm outta here. "/>

I mean, it's in Las Vegas, isn't that enough of a clue to the purpose of the event? The best thing is to just let other people do the donkey work of pulling the interesting stuff from these events and then thinking about it. I thought about going to BETT (the education in technology show) this week, but decided not to. It would be a big, lumbering, commercialised disappointment. The manufacturers are trying to sell new stuff to customers - be they corporate, educational, individual - which are supposedly 'new ideas'. They do things which are either obvious or unnecessary inefficiently, while the good ideas simmer under the surface (often utilising old time ideas) and let people innovate. None of that stuff happens in the big tech shows at Earl's Court or Las Vegas or the Portable Media Expo (to pluck some examples). And that's wh..."/>

      <outline text="We're getting somewhere on the industrial-strength torrent serving project. It seems Azureus can handle much of the hosting problem, but we still need to be able to go from a RSS feed with MP3 enclosures to a RSS feed with torrent enclosures. Of course generating the RSS feed is no trouble at all, but we still need an automatic way of turning the MP3s into torrents. My exploration has led me back to work Andrew Grumet did in 2004 to teach Radio how to download torrent enclosures. All this work should connect well with the NewsRiver aggregator, when we get to that step. "/>

When Microsoft and others pick at the details of RSS, things that were decided years ago, I wish they would help as only they can help, by spreading the word far and wide, helping people make better use of the Internet, now, not when they're ready to profit from it. There are lives being wasted today, problems that urgently need solving that this technology can help solve, a technology whose promise is that it can help people work together. Yet the tech industry always seems to use the promise to drive us into warring camps, much as the Republicans and Democrats do every time we make a political decision in this country."/>

My friend David and I arrived in San Jose and went right the the theater to check out the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.  I had lowered expectation after the review I wrote about.  You know what, screw that review.  The movie is a really fun time with plenty of service for the trufans.  It's clear to me that that guy just takes Hitchhiker's too seriously.  It has always been different in all of it forms (radio, books, TV) and this is just another iteration.  I really don't think that the writers didn't understand how the Infinite Improbability Drive worked (as if there is a HHGTTG Tech Manual or something) it's just that they thought all the weird forms would be funny.  And I don't think that they left the John Malkovich plot dangling...there is no plot.  His part was just a gag like pretty much every part.

When the blue-and-white was dying coming up on two years ago I had to set something up fast.  I was doing most of my work on a PowerBook so the eMac seemed like a good cost/benefit choice and it has served me well.

      <outline text="An excellent PSP review is up at Ars Technica:I am in love with the PSP though. It's console-level gaming in the palm of your hand. With headphones you can have a great game almost anywhere, with no meaningful diminishment in quality or graphics from the fact that you are using a handheld. If you're fairly tech literate, finding torrents of your favorite shows, or ripping your own DVDs to play on the PSP is a no brainer, and the MP3 functions are just icing on the cake.

The rumors of browsers and full net support only make it even more tempting. Already there's a hack for Wipeout Pure that lets you surf the web in a limited fashion. With the wireless download capability and beefy firmware, the possibilities for Sony improving the functionality are almost limitless.

      <outline text="I made it!  A year ago today I made my first blog post.  It was with a great deal of hesitation.  As I said in that post I had never kept a public or private journal before.  I didn't really know what I was getting myself into.  Now blogging has become an important part of my life.  

Before starting my blog I was reading about 10 blogs on a regular basis.  I'm now subscribed to 86 RSS feeds and I read a dozen other blogs (hey guys - let's move to RSS!)

I looked back at the archives for that first month and it's just amazing the recall I get.  I can see where I was and recall what I was thinking quite clearly by looking at those posts.  I can just imagine what that will be worth down the road.  It's so easy to forget thoughts and feelings.  Since I can I've added a One Year Ago section on my right sidebar.

It's disintermediation, the thing that the Internet does to every business, art and profession that aggregates and repackages. Carl Sagan said that human beings are the cosmos gaining consciousness and studying itself. The tech bloggers are the tech community, the programmers, lawyers, investors, business managers, users, taking responsibility for their own cosmos. The reporters were necessary when you needed a million dollars to start a news &quot;paper,&quot; then a billion dollars to start a media empire. Now you need a laptop computer and an account on Blogger or MSN Spaces. "/>

An enviable posiiton. "/>
      <outline text="John Battelle almost gets there today in figuring out where the limits are for Google. First, Microsoft is not the prior art, Netscape is. What was their failure? They didn't create opportunities for other tech companies to lock them in. That's where P/E comes from in the tech world. You need a growing community of businesses who depend on your survival to keep you growing. The leaders at Netscape didn't get that they had a wonderful platform -- HTML and HTTP. Instead they tried to create a new one, Java, and that was wrong. They died for that sin. I think Google misunderstands that their platform is advertising, that's a temporary transitional thing, the real platform is (doh) Search. Why do you think I called for their competitors to clone the Google API without the limits? Because I gave up on Google ever figuring this out. But there's still time. They could open up their back end and let the entrepreneurial juices work toward locking them in. It's too much to expect Microsoft or Ya..."/>

I got to meet Om Malik, and had a good talk with Anil Dash, who tells me that TypePad has some very nice OPML support."/>

      <outline text="We're filling up the world with technology and devices, but we've lost sight of an important question: What is this stuff for? What value does it add to our lives? So asks author John Thackara in his new book, In the Bubble: Designing for a Complex World. These are tough questions for the pushers of technology to answer. Our economic system is centred on technology, so it would be no small matter if &quot;tech&quot; ceased to be an end-in-itself in our daily lives. Technology is not going to go away, but the time to discuss the ends it will serve is before we deploy it, not after. We need to ask what purpose will be served by the broadband communications, smart materials, wearable computing, and connected appliances that we're unleashing upon the world. We need to ask what impact all this stuff will have on our daily lives. Who will look after it, and how? In the Bubble is about a world based less on stuff, and more on people. Thackara describes a transformation that is taking place now - not in..."/>

      <outline text="What he says is so true. Too many software developers wander into the market without knowing what's been tried before, what worked, what didn't. Often the users know more about the history of the category than the designer of the software. What Mike does, by writing up every product and service that he sees, is the beginning of a process that we must develop; but is itself a revisit of something that used to be done thoroughly and systematically, but because of the quick pace of boom and bust in the tech business, is an art that now needs to be reinvented, a bootup that's actually a reboot."/>

      <outline text="This is the struggle we are constantly dealing with in the tech business. For a while we send up a beacon, a shining star, and it's exciting! Then they forget their values, where they came from, what made it work for them, and we follow them down into bad years. You'd think we could learn, but apparently we can't. Now can we survive their downfall? That's a good question, and one I don't know the answer to."/>

      <outline text="There's an undertone of excitement in the speculation around the net that a new tech bubble is rising. I've found myself feeling a little caught up in the buzz, even though, like millions of others, the other bubble was not so kind to me or my job or my now-laughable IRA balance."/>
      <outline text="But maybe we shouldn't feed the buzz with giddiness that implies by omission that a rollercoaster ride is a completely positive experience -- or that it's the only mode of transportation to the state of Prosperity.  Maybe it would serve everybody better to turn the conversation to growth with longer-term stability in tech business. Or at least try to talk about permanent vitality along with the manic bubble babble."/>
      <outline text="One thing I want to say in my BBQ keynote tonight is that one good thing that's happening is that people are trying out new ideas again. That should be a constant in the tech industry, in good times and in bad. There should always be money for new ideas because you never know which one will turn into the next Visicalc, Wordstar, Mac OS, Excel, Web or whatever. Too many years of drought between the years of wine and roses. "/>
      <outline text="If we find one that works, that's the begining of a gender-balanced tech industry. Have a conference where we discuss the confluence of technology and librarians (I'm sure there are already such conferences, how many tech industry people go to them?) Are there conferences where they bemoan the lack of men? Interesting question. I can't imagine the men complaining too much about it, actually. "/>
      <outline text="In any case, I suspect most men in the tech industry would be happy to have more women. Believe it or not, many of us like women. There's nothing more dull than a conference with 100 men and 2 women. You need a good mix to keep things interesting. "/>
      <outline text="The Greensboro blogging conference earlier this month was more interesting because there were far more black people there than I've ever seen at a tech industry conference. How did this happen? They chose North Carolina A&amp;T, a state college that's largely black, to host the event. The professors and students were all black, as were many participants of the community. There's a big lesson in that. If you want change, like Dorothy, you have to leave Kansas, you can't expect change to come to you, you have to go there."/>

      <outline text="It's hard to convey how much talent was at dinner last night at Jing Jing's in Palo Alto. I mentioned a bunch of them in the Reading Lists announcement above. But I didn't mention that Gabe Rivera, the author of Memeorandum was there too. I've become a regular user, subscribed to its RSS feed, and several times a day I visit the site and use it as an aggregator of what's happening in the tech blogosphere. It's become a totally essential tool, in just a few weeks. All the while I'm thinking it would work much better in OPML than it does in RSS, so before our meeting yesterday, I asked Gabe for an OPML readout, and this morning there is one. I've linked it into my community box at the right, so you can browse it in HTML, but more important to me is that I can browse it in my outliner. It's very much a beginning, because I immediately think of features I need to make it really work (like a Refresh button, for example). But we're off to a good start. "/>

      <outline text="After years of maintaining absolute control over user's data in Microsoft Office, the new version promises to give total control to the user, and creates a path for developers to siphon users from Microsoft to new or specialized products. One would think that this would spawn an explosion of new products designed to please Office users but that's not what's happening. A group of large technology companies is proposing a competing set of formats, and has formed an alliance to confuse the market, and at least double the work of any developer who might want to support their products (with almost no installed base) alongside Microsoft's (with a monopolistic dominant installed base). It's not surprising that the group is lead by the detritus of the last generation of tech companies. The thriving companies, Google, Yahoo and others have the good sense to sit this time and money-waster out. "/>

      <outline text="Next week I'll be in the Bay Area attending the WIRED Rave Awards on Monday night. I'm nominated this year in the Software Designer category, along with the designers of Friendster, Skype, BitTorrent and iTunes. I was nominated for work with RSS. With any luck, we'll be able to announce Andrew Grumet's work that connects RSS with BitTorrent. We're very excited about combining syndication with Big Media Objects. It would be cool to make the announcement on the day of the award ceremony, March 15, in San Francisco."/>
      <outline text="Thanks to the Berkman Thursdays team. We've planned a conference, been to New Hampshire, we're getting ready to bootstrap the next generation of blogging tech. This group, the Berkman Brigade (perhaps) is ready to kick butt in 2004, and I'm ready to do it with yuz. Let's go!"/>
      <outline text="There's a sub-directory containing links to all the feeds, and a place for questions and comments, but I wanted to publish the URLs of the feeds themselves here so that you can see how simple and easy the format is. "/>
      <outline text="It's designed to be comprehensible to a person who might know how to set up a stereo system or program a VCR. And it's even easier to use than either of those earlier technologies. You just tell a reader (there are lots, it's a burgeoning market) to subscribe to one or all of these feeds, and every hour it will check for new stuff and show it to you. "/>
      <outline text="On July 15, UserLand Software transferred ownership of its RSS 2.0 specification to the Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard Law School. "/>
      <outline text="An advisory board, independent of Berkman and Harvard, was formed to broaden the public understanding of the uses and benefits of RSS, and to guide developers who create RSS applications. The initial members of the board are Jon Udell, lead analyst for InfoWorld and columnist for the O'Reilly Network; Brent Simmons of Ranchero Software, author of NetNewsWire, a leading RSS-based application, and myself."/>
      <outline text="Cooper said &quot;Politics doesn't always have to trump good sense.&quot; RSS, for all the battles about it, is a testament to that principle. We're accumulating links to articles about RSS in the directory at the new RSS 2.0 website at Berkman."/>
      <outline text="Microsoft, AOL, Amazon and Yahoo support the format, compatibly, as do Apple, Oracle and Cisco. Almost without exception, tech companies aren't fighting over this format."/>
      <outline text="One of the key features of RSS 2.0 is its extensibility. Any developer can add new modules to the format and lobby other developers to support their extensions. In a phone talk with AOL developers last week we encouraged them to take the lead in multimedia and community extensions, areas where they have expertise, and power due their enormous installed base. "/>
      <outline text="The power of the software developer not to develop is largely silent, so people often don't consider it. Sure the original author may toil at a money-losing labor-of-love long past the point where it has been proven not to be viable, but what about the people he or she is not hiring, the manual writers, testers, more programmers, a sales person, a marketing person perhaps, to work on ease of use and to keep the website current. How about a couple of tech support people (so they can take a vacation once in a while, it's a tough job). It goes without saying, I hope, that these people don't work for free. So if you don't want to pay, you can't have any of it. "/>
      <outline text="Last year the big news was thousands of weblogs in Iran. Because I only read English, I can't read most of what they write, but I can see that there are excited people in Iran, experiencing intellectual freedom, against the law, against the religion; but doing it anyway. They're mostly young and mostly in the capital Tehran. Many are women. A repressive government with a wired populace. That can't last for long. Which one yields? Time will tell. "/>
      <outline text="It's still an exciting idea, if they decided to do it, I'd work for them for $1 per year to see it through. In my humble opinion, the logjam over music on the Internet is a big reason that growth is so elusive today in the tech industry."/>
      <outline text="In May 1999, Scott Rosenberg at Salon wrote the first weblog piece outside the weblog community, and it rippled through the then-small world of weblogs. I pointed to it from Scripting News, in DaveNet, and later from Weblogs.Com. "/>
      <outline text="Back in the early 90s, before the Web became the thing, the talk of the industry was a concept called convergence. The media industry and the tech industry would become one. Today that's been realized, and what a mess it is. Now they know what it feels like to be on our side of the fence, and we're getting a taste of what it's like from their point of view. The hope is that this increases understanding. Perhaps we can find new ways to work together, don't just believe and repeat the hype, think, evaluate, let's take a different course this time. Remember the Golden Rule and practice it."/>
      <outline text="Amen to that. Properly invested, the money and minds of Silicon Valley are perfectly aligned with the freedom the Internet offers. The idealistic story of the mid-90s was the correct one; the dotcom model, a detour. In the tech industry we make tools for artists, thinkers, journalists, academics, marketers, engineers, lawyers, to create and communicate. "/>
      <outline text="On Monday an op-ed piece ran in the Financial Times by Disney CEO Michael Eisner. It's a highly moralistic essay, about slavery and Abraham Lincoln. Eisner says Lincoln would have loved the Internet and hated the piracy. It's a must-read for people who want to understand the faceoff between the entertainment industry and its users, with the technology industry caught in the middle. I have strong opinions about this both as a user of their product, and a member of the tech industry."/>
      <outline text="There's nothing terribly wrong with the economy, says Greenspan, unemployment is down, things are getting better in the economy at large. All that's in the way of tech participating in the recovery are some new exciting ideas. We have a few of those coming down the pike. Seeya soon!"/>
      <outline text="They have all kinds of applications in mind for Segway. I talked with Dean Kamen and asked what his aspirations are. He's thinking quite big. Like a lot of instantly popular entrepreneurs the rush of fame and adulation has gone to his head. At this meeting were about 100 other people, including some formerly huge names in high tech. The one negative of the evening was Kamen's hubris, which he can be forgiven for. I'd like him to be serious, not self-indulgent, if his invention is to have the chance it deserves, he'll have to get over himself, at least a little."/>
      <outline text="Anyway if we want to get our economy growing at the steep rate dictated by Moore's Law, we have to change the way the tech industry thinks about competition, innovation and user choice. In many ways this is the same challenge that the US faces as we redefine our role in the world after the Sept 11 catastrophe."/>
      <outline text="Last night Wired Magazine announced their Rave Awards for 2001, honoring me with their top Tech Renegade award, for work on SOAP, which began in this column in February 1998. "/>
      <outline text="Should the Web have welcomed the BigCo's on their terms, or on the terms of the Web? The Web favors low-tech easy-to-implement formats and protocols. The BigCo's for whatever reason, promote difficult formats and protocols, that tend to split the users into groups based on whose software they use, and tend to marginalize smaller developers. It's hard to switch from one brand to another. Progress may grind to a halt while they fight in court. And small companies and independent developers who are philosophically opposed to software patents will be frozen or killed while the BigCo's fight over control of the Web."/>
      <outline text="The magic of the Web is its freedom and utter low-tech-ness. The cynics who sniffed at the idealists were wrong, the dotcom crazyness is over, and the Web survives, precisely because it is open to everyone. "/>
      <outline text="Remember a couple of weeks ago (seems like a lifetime) when I wrote about gender balance in high tech? The piece was filled with generalizations. Men do art and war, women do civilization and infrastructure, etc. "/>
      <outline text="First I want to thank the readers of DaveNet for indulging my fantasies in the last piece about Gender Balance in High Tech. It was great to get those ideas out, and even better that for the most part my point of view was tolerated, even though I am a man and am supposed to be politically correct and only say things that are pre-approved by the feminist culture I'm part of. That of course, was the point. It hardly matters that I was making generalizations about gender, that just happens to be what my mind revolves around, something I have in common with most adult women and men (another generalization of course)."/>

      <outline text="So let's see if we can get some new tech stuff happening in NY, not the make-believe tech stuff of the last few years, but the real kind. We've got lots of resources, lots of geeks, and a few marketing people (yes, we still need you). I'll get the word around that the list started, and let the NYers take it from there. I'm behind you all the way. Let's Go New York!"/>
      <outline text="Come for great spicy Italian seafood and great spicy tech conversation and networking."/>
      <outline text="I really enjoy explaining new technology to investors, and from what Chris tells me, they liked hearing from a person who really does development, and isn't selling pet food or promoting other weird business models. This is a sign that perhaps some sobriety and respect are returning to the tech investment environment, that technology may again have a chance to attract investment, and that independent software developers have a voice that matters. As always, none of this can work unless we work together. Some projects will make money, and others will build infrastructure and guarantee choice and probably not make money, but will still be worth doing. Technology has never been an easy investment, the euphoria which is dead-dead-dead masked that for a few years. To do this well, we have to communicate, and Monday's conference call was an excellent beginning. "/>
      <outline text="In the early 90s we invented higher level protocols on Windows and Mac -- COM and Apple Events, at their best they are Unix-inspired, clean, low-tech, free of lock-in. And interestingly it was done on Unix too, it's called HTTP, and it's the basis for the Web, and is a marvel of simplicity and power. Right on. It was quickly adopted on all platforms, not just Unix. But still, to this day, source-code-level integration is the norm on Unix where it's practically unheard-of in the commercial world. Is it any wonder that commercial developers invented SOAP and XML-RPC? We couldn't make the Web work for our software without doing that. "/>
      <outline text="Without exception journalists say no to Microsoft's Smart Tags. The geeks scratch their heads wondering why the journalists see issues of integrity, but the proposed Microsoft technology cuts right to the core of what we do. It will confuse readers. Why does the word &quot;shark&quot; point to a San Jose hockey team and not to a sea animal or a high-tech exec? Who added that link? Has this author lost his mind? Why is he promoting Microsoft products? Why should we believe him? It looks like he sold out! (There's that pesky appearance of impropriety thing again.)"/>
      <outline text="*  Suzanne Lainson writes a blog about the Colorado tech scene, written in the style of a society columnist, for Courtney Pulitzer's The Cyber Scene. &quot;It turns out it has been a much more enjoyable experience than I had ever imagined,&quot; Lainson says by e-mail. &quot;I can write about people, companies and events that wouldn't be considered newsworthy in a traditional sense. While I do incorporate serious reporting, I offer considerable commentary ? a good chunk of it done tongue in cheek.&quot; "/>
      <outline text="*  Boston Globe business reporter D.C. Denison recently began writing a tech-news Weblog. "/>
      <outline text="And you can pick it up by a different thread and it's one of the most ambitious and successful open source projects in history. Most of the XML-RPC implementations are open source. Leaders of the open source world from Eric S. Raymond to Tim O'Reilly are big fans of XML-RPC. The Slashdot guys love it. Why? Because it's simple, low-tech, and it gives developers freedom to choose their development environment. "/>
      <outline text="Another theory of what's going on in the tech industry: Shakeout. "/>
      <outline text="Dan Gillmor of the San Jose Mercury-News was one of the first tech journalists to take up weblogging, and he got the first review of HailStorm on the Web, straight from Building 33 in Redmond. &quot;[HailStorm is] the most centralized thing I've seen in years, from a company that hooted down the idea of the Network Computer until the concept suddenly seemed to translate into a multi-billion-dollar annuity income for our favorite monopolist.&quot;"/>
      <outline text="&quot;It's the hacker ethic at work. Interop is slow to come on the recommended path. So the Lone Hacker takes things into his own hands and links the Big Product to the indy network that had interop a year ago, painlessly, because the spec is so low-tech and easy.&quot;"/>
      <outline text="One more thought. The magic of the Web, HTTP and HTML, its utter simplicity, is based on its willingness to acknowledge broken links. This is something the big companies can never accept. But low tech always rules, it always has, it's only been an illiusion that everything could work outside of Murphy's Law, and a new (proposed) corollary, &quot;You can't beat Murphy, so stop trying.&quot;"/>
      <outline text="Craig Barrett, the CEO of Intel gave a speech on Tuesday last week in San Jose. He said Intel was going to spend its way through the recession. What a great idea. A dollar goes a lot further today than it did a year ago. The competition has been dramatically reduced. You can actually rent office space in Silicon Valley, and you can hire good people. It's turned into a buyer's market. If you believe the tech industry is coming back, the only rational choice is to invest now in new products, while people and facilities are available and relatively cheap."/>
      <outline text="Internet 3.0 will be a bootstrap. No steps will be skipped. This is why static low-tech formats based on XML are central to the next level of services, alongside the dynamic SOAP and XML-RPC-based services. It will scale from day one. "/>
      <outline text="Most of the technologists I know have very high integrity, as much as most doctors, lawyers and cops. However because we have no rules, we're vulnerable to cheap shots and pretenders. That's the other side, the presumption of lack of integrity, and the tech press takes advantage of this."/>
      <outline text="Now the tech industry is that sick, and it needs a cure. The venture capitalists, who have lead us for the last dozen years, made mostly short-term investments. Even worse, they backed a socialization of software development, so that virtually all the money is out of it. With due respect to my sensitive friends in the open source development community, this is not about you, it's about the VC's belief that they can wish money into existence out of thin air. This premise worked fine while the stock market went along with the dream, and the users were happy, it's like a dream come true for them, everything's free! It had to end sometime. It did. Ooops."/>
      <outline text="But the tech press, they travel in packs and herds, rewriting each others' stories. I've watched them climb on the back of technology so many times proclaiming that X Kills Y, quoting analysts who are on the payroll of X or Y, pretending that there's some integrity to this. It's gotten so bad that even experimental technologies that hold great promise are dis'd before they get a chance. (What if they reported on medicine this way?)"/>
      <outline text="I can hear Newsweek's Deborah Branscum cringing, she thinks of tech people the same way, but it's our marketing shills and carpetbaggers she's complaining about. Stop listening to them and they'll go away. (Please!)"/>
      <outline text="Since you read DaveNet, you know that. There's a lot more. They interviewed seven other high tech people from the Bay Area. "/>
      <outline text="(Hint: There's more to tech than Dot-Coms.)"/>
      <outline text="PS: Salon has an excerpt from Alan Deutschman's new Steve Jobs book. I'm in both the book and the excerpt. A long time ago I ran an account of an internal Apple meeting, written by an Apple employee. Now we're getting a new Mac OS X product together, one that takes advantage of its server-side prowess and delivers Mac-like ease of use to people who log on via the Web. It will allow Apple's cube to leapfrog the Cobalt one. I can't wait to demo it to Steve!"/>
      <outline text="Along with a small number of CEOs (mostly in the weblog community), I write publicly on a daily basis, and accept some of the limitations of being a journalist. I keep my money in mutual funds and real estate, I don't make personal investments in the companies I write about. I own a lot of UserLand stock and some Critical Path stock that I got when a company I invested in in the late 80s was acquired by them. The mutual funds are blue chips, not tech stocks."/>
      <outline text="I'm on a private mail list with no archives that's super-high-flow and populated by the music industry with a sprinkling of tech people like myself. The following is a message I posted this morning. "/>
      <outline text="The best advice I can offer the music industry based on my experience in tech is to give the users what they want. Don't try to negotiate. Just give it to them."/>

      <outline text="I believe there's deep corruption at the core of supposedly &quot;open&quot; businesses. It's so in your face you have to go into denial to miss it. However, we're going to wait, when we strike, it's going to be clear and well thought-out, and I won't be alone in raising the questions. We're going to put names on the shadows, and if people care about integrity, it will change the way things are done in high tech and the Internet."/>
      <outline text="Bottom line, if someone squeals when a question is raised, I assume they have something to hide, and I'll go even deeper. So squeal with care. Better to clean house now, change your practices, open up processes, look at ways you're holding back progress. Make your practices match your hype, or stop hyping. The music industry is learning the lesson. The next industry to be routed out and cleaned up is high tech, and along with them, journalists who play ball and don't go deep."/>

We all laugh. I can't tell you what a relief it is to me, an American Jew, to see peace in the Middle East. The wisdom of the Peres' years contrasts the youth of Abdullah. This is what a shared vision looks like. This is something the high-tech industry has yet to get. I hope I live to see that day too."/>

      <outline text="So I called Compaq. We spent 1.5 hours wasting time because the service tech didn't listen to me explain what was going on. Another 1.5 hours later my wireless phone ran out of batteries and we got disconnected and I had to start over with another tech."/>
      <outline text="Basically the machine doesn't network, and without that it's completely useless to me. The next step was to escalate it, to have a service tech come to my workplace and fart around with the system, but I decided instead to say goodbye to Compaq and their misery. I called my credit card company and cancelled payment. "/>

      <outline text="To the high-tech VCs, here's your business model. Start the Internet music label. Contract with the big name performers that the current labels are leaving behind. Give the artists stock options proportional to the number of page reads they generate. Give them a shot to hit the moon. Work around the airwave distribution system. Use the artists' name recognition to build credibility for the Internet Music Hub, which in my humble opinion, does not yet exist."/>
      <outline text="Earlier today Netscape announced a new low-tech format for syndicating web content called RSS, for RDF Site Specification. It's a more realistic spec than the one proposed by Microsoft several years ago, called CDF, or Channel Definition Format, because it reflects the dynamic nature of news-oriented sites."/>

      <outline text="The big casualty in the onslaught of the net is wizzyness. It's an anti-wizzy environment, it's in the genetics of the net to not be wizzy. Scripts, HTML, databases, Java. Netscape isn't as high tech as OpenDoc. Not a wizzy design tool in sight. And the net is stubborn. It resists attempts to make it wizzy."/>

And it seems there's nothing to be done about leaky roofs! I live in an old house. The part I work in has a flat roof and a skylight. Every year we do maintenence, hire roofers, fix the holes, only to find that new leaks sprout. What can I do? Not much. I love the woods, the creek, the live oak trees, the great birds, my garden. A leaky roof seems a small price to pay."/>

      <outline text="Netscape is VisiCalc. There's still a play for a 1-2-3. They built a company that looks like any Silicon Valley high tech firm. They're no threat to Microsoft. The real action will come from a new company that's not much of a company at all. One that takes a back seat to net users. Acts as an enabler with no control. A company whose bylaws say that every employee must have a personal website. Such a company would give Microsoft a lot of grief! And that's what Microsoft asks for, so it will get it."/>
      <outline text="Here comes ODB Engine 1.0, a royalty-free toolkit that makes it easy to add a solid, fast, low-tech, soon-to-be-cross-platform storage system for apps and system software. "/>
      <outline text="This is not true in the ISP world. The norm is outages. Companies growing too fast for their customer's good. A lack of organization on the other end. Lack of good testing procedures. The system is cobbled together. The wires are exposed, they're always tripping over them. Their monitoring software doesn't detect the problems, so customers have to. And often the customers don't have the expertise to explain why the system isn't working. Tech support reps won't treat people like adults (or customers!) unless they speak the jargon. Now I do speak the jargon, so I can see clearly how unacceptable the current situation is."/>
      <outline text="I got a call from John Doerr, jdoerr@kpcb.com, one of the valley's leading venture capitalists. I know John thru my association with Symantec, we were both on its board of directors in the late eighties. He's backed lots of successful high tech ventures, including Sun, Compaq, Lotus and Netscape. John is intense! He takes risks, and sticks his neck out. Doerr has focus, and sometimes this frustrates people who work with him. But watch out when he focuses on something, because something could happen. "/>
      <outline text="He talked, I listened. Politics! A proposition on the November ballot that threatens to completely change the rules of operating a corporation in California. It will make the lawyers more powerful. Much more! It would cripple the high tech financial system. It'll be impossible to manage a company, not just in California, because the prop covers all companies that have shareholders that live in California. Only fools will expose themselves. Only fools will invest. Make sure you're broke before you go public. Hmmm. How does that work?"/>
      <outline text="But Don Crabb, a MacWEEK columnist, says Apple should cook great meals and let developers serve the appetizers. No way Don Crabb. Apple could be a stove. A hot fast file system and net connection and a clean low-tech process manager. The user interface stays constant. No one likes a stove that moves around too much. They tend to explode. Simmer for a while, then turn up the heat, get it right, and then don't mess with it. We'll cook the meals. Tasty stuff! And filling. "/>
      <outline text="This time around we get a chance to see a market evolving a new GUI instead of it coming out of a R&amp;D lab. The Unix culture meets the desktop. Will Sun have a clue how to evolve a new platform? Maybe. How quickly will Microsoft move their source base in front of the flood of new Java system software? Will the Mac community get organized and do something elegant and low-tech in time to make a difference?"/>

      <outline text="Now, with the addition of the Internet to personal computing, and its clean low-tech well-understood APIs, it's time to think about RPC again. The Internet is the vendorless platform. It's a groupware system. Let's try again. We can work together!"/>
      <outline text="If Apple wants to be taken seriously in the server world, new system software is needed. The Mac file system is creaky old legacy code. We need a new low-tech file system that works with WebStar. Performance is everything. In the meantime, the Mac makes a great CGI platform."/>
      <outline text="Because freedom is the essential fuel that's driving the growth and optimism in the web and high-tech worlds."/>
      <outline text="The Java world is so loose, its limits are so unknown. Who's going to do the new APIs that are needed for persistent storage, interapplication communication and node-to-node communication? Script editing and debugging? How will these protocols compare to the current protocols of the Internet and the single-system wires already in place on the desktop platforms? Will the APIs be horrendous or airy and easy and low-tech like the APIs of the Internet? These APIs will be hybrids of the APIs used in desktop operating systems and the protocols of the Internet. "/>
      <outline text="They offer a solution. They want me to buy MORE from Symantec and continue to enhance it and make it better. It's very tempting. I still use MORE. I do huge high-tech web pages in MORE. I've hooked it into Clay Basket so Clay automatically converts my MORE outlines to HTML outlines, totally automatically, as it builds my website. It's very powerful stuff, but like a lot of MORE users, I really want a few features that would make it even more powerful for me. So, I'd be very happy to work on MORE. But I don't want to own it.

      <outline text="Here's my short list of things Java's probably going to be good for: animations; automatically playing sounds when a document is retrieved or a link activated (note that Microsoft has already added this to Internet Explorer as an HTML tag -- without Java); networked real-time games where the app is local and the only net traffic is broadcasting player position changes and the like; &quot;worlds chat&quot;-type stuff (3d avatars, etc.); tech support applications: realtime remote control (Timbuktu/Telnet-like) with local system querying so a support technician (or sufficiently powerful expert system, I suppose) can diagnose and fix problems with non-net-related software (how do I make a newsletter in Word 72.5?); interaction between browser software and non-net-related software, especially for tech support and interfacing remote databases with local documents (including local databases, accounting systems, production systems, etc.); local browser agents (clipping services, price-hunters, etc.); be..."/>
      <outline text="Netscape is the next approximation of the pure-PE ratio company. I haven't looked at their balance sheet, and I don't need to. As a developer I see it much more clearly. They've soaked up lots of the available love in the high tech world. But there's lots more to give, and he or she who bathes in that love will be the next approximation. "/>
      <outline text="The net is so damned fast. Now I'm debugging at the TCP level. Maybe it's so amazingly fast because for the first time I have a real sense of how it works. Are phones fast? Yes, of course -- but I don't think of them that way because I have no idea how they actually work. But a Ping call across the Internet happens in a fraction of a second. I could be talking to a computer in Sausilito or Florida or Virginia or Austin. It happens in an instant. There's so much talking going on. And it's so simple. It's very low-tech stuff, but it works! Keep OpenDoc and OLE -- I'll go for a no-brainer any day. Thank you."/>
      <outline text="I also try to follow the stock market, and although I didn't buy or sell any high tech stock this year, I think I figured something out that a lot of other people may be figuring out too -- the market doesn't value distribution strength. It doesn't place a high value on the number of units you'll sell in the future, especially if your margins are staying the same or shrinking. The normal boring details of running a business don't interest the stock market. This is very contrary to my education! They always taught us that the purpose of business is to make profits. But we have to let go of that idea."/>
      <outline text="The Wall Street Journal says Microsoft is &quot;orchestrating a buzz that is reaching far beyond the tech world, involving a wide range of business partners -- including the Rolling Stones, whose 'Start Me Up' will be a sort of Windows 95 theme song, anchoring TV ads set to start airing Thursday evening.&quot;"/>
      <outline text="To those that doubt that a Macintosh makes a great WWW server, check it out. My interactive website is very fast! People assume that it's the Mac's fault that the Apple Event Manager is so slow. Not true. We got around the problem in Frontier. This is new tech stuff. Look twice. Don't blink! Yes that really is a Mac."/>
      <outline text="I don't think we took full advantage of those opportunities. Look where we're at, less than thirty years later and we're repeating the mistakes. The Exon bill may be the equivalent of the Tonkin Gulf Resolution. The people of the Internet, an international crowd, are confused and dismayed. There are so many parallels. In high tech today the USA is the major world power. Before Vietnam we were the world's policeman. The judgement of our political leaders may be as disastrous now as it was in the sixties."/>
      <outline text="You see, Dave, the sixteen Senators who voted against Exon are essentially the only sixteen people in the Senate who either learned the lessons of the sixties while they were cutting their teeth as politicians (Moynihan, Kennedy) or who were involved more actively, such as Robb, who was an officer on the front lines in Vietnam who later spoke out against the war in spite of the fact that LBJ was his father-in-law! And you may say that Patty Murray voted against it to appease the lobbyists from Microsoft and other Washington-based high-tech firms, but at least it shows she's in touch with the zeitgeist."/>
      <outline text="So far the Web has been like a great hippie rock festival. We're all brothers and sisters. I suspect the vibes will eventually change, somewhere down the line, when it gets crowded, but so far there's so much blue sky, we don't bump into each other too often, so we're all friends. Other industries have managed to get along with each other better, with more expedience, than high-tech has. Maybe their influence will rub off? I hope so!"/>
      <outline text="In earlier DaveNet pieces I counseled high tech investors to reorganize their businesses around the boom in online software. I failed to heed my own advice! We continued to butt our heads against the retail distribution system, a system which is rapidly becoming obsolete, IMHO."/>

      <outline text="This calls us back to the early days of Lou Gerstner at IBM and an article that appeared in Fortune (I think, my memory is blurry) that took him apart for his proclamation that vision was unnecessary for the CEO of a high-tech company. I think he was actually trying to position himself against Bill Gates, he probably thought he was being clever, but he was wrong, the vision of a high-tech CEO is absolutely essential to the viability of the company he or she is CEO of. "/>
      <outline text="The article says that IBM has no coherent strategy for offering wide-area network services to users of personal computers. They are in reaction mode, again, and surprise, they're reacting to Bill Gates, the CEO of a high-tech company who bothers to have a vision. "/>

      <outline text="I noticed that tech bloggers are quiet on the weekends. Actually, they go quiet on Friday after lunch. I have been curious as to why? What causes us to hibernate on the weekend. In my case, there are numerous school related events, family events, visiting our friends, keeping the Corporate books up-to-date, sleepovers. I have even considered that most of the geeks in the country are quiet on Friday night because they are watching the Sci-Fi Channel. Which I do if I have a chance. I also thought that maybe the really geeky bloggers who are still single and un-attached spend the weekends coding to catch up with their projects. I have seen a prodigious amount of information posted to the web during the week and I have often wondered when do these people work? 1-3am? They must be really good coders spitting out clean code line after line. However, I know that those types of coders are few and far between.

      <outline text="While I'm at it, the &quot;summit&quot; next Wednesday, at Google, is still a bad idea. It should be open to anyone who wants to participate, and it should be bloggable, and it shouldn't be called a summit. How arrogant of Technorati to think they can decide who goes to a summit. Feh. And it shouldn't be at Google. It would be so easy to get a classroom, or a conference room at a library (they're free in Berkeley, probably in Mountain View too) or even at a local branch of the Bank of America. Doing it at Google will stifle the conversation, and help reinforce the very bad idea that the tech world revolves around them, one that I'm sure they don't mind pushing, but why should we support it?

      <outline text="It seems the tech industry cares more about not being criticized than in building something that works. That certainly describes Google, and I was surprised to find out it also describes today's Microsoft. I would have been happy to work the hallways at PDC, maybe even speak. Maybe someone on their Team RSS can explain. Was it an oversight? Did anyone ask if I should be part of the RSS conversation at PDC? It left a really bad feeling, and not much of a basis for working together in the future. I'm behind the curve now, I don't know what they're doing with RSS, I find myself in the awkward position of having to tell reporters who ask what I think that they know more about what MS is doing in RSS than I do.

      <outline text="Hi Adam,
 
  I'm sure this one of many many emails you've recieved from newbies such as myself. First off, The past few months have literally changed my whole perspective on things. When iTunes 4.9 came out, I was introduced (finally) to the wonderful world of podcasting. I'll be honest Adam. I feel I can and will make a name for myself  in podcasting. There is one problem though, when it comes to the tech side of things, I don't know where to start. Is simplly want to put out a quality sounding show where I can talk to the listeners, play them kick ass music that they should be hearing but aren't, and maybe make somebody laugh they're ass off from time to time. That's not too much to ask, is it?  Not that you wouldn't, but I feel I like I may not get a reply from you due to the volume of emails you must recieve. However, if anyone would have the right answer to my question, it would be Adam Curry. 
 
 I'm a PC user (boo hiss). I know I know. I'll have a mac soon if it fucking kills me..."/>

      <outline text="The Chinese use various strategies for acquiring sensitive technology,  Eftimiades told Congress last year, from tasking &quot;co-optees&quot; to acquire  specific technical information to acquiring small American high-tech firms  outright through Chinese state-run firms. But a common MSS technique,  Eftimiades said, is to recruit agents to acquire advanced technology  through front companies that may or may not be engaged in legitimate  business activities as well.

I've found a nice apartment in Berkeley, right in the middle of things, in an area they call The Gourmet Ghetto. That means I'll be part of the Bay Area tech community again, but from a different geographic perspective. Berkeley is a People's Republic, just like Cambridge, Mass. It's near a big airport, that's a big difference from the beach in Florida which is three hours from Orlando, and two from Jacksonville. I'll be more mobile here. I've got quite a network here, ready-to-go. Will this be good for the OPML project, good for podcasting and RSS? Without a doubt. "/>

Podcasting has become both an aid and a source of trouble in my quest to stay informed.Podcasting has allowed me to use my drive time as a learning time, at the expense of NPR and Sports talk radio. The loss of Sports talk will become a problem as football season begins but I could care less about baseball so its all good for now. I find myself gravitating to shows of two types. The first being the panel discussion show, ie the Gilmour Gang and TWIT. The second being the more in depth look at topics podcasts such as some of the IT Conversations podcasts. What I seldom listen to and when I do I get little benefit from is the &quot;tech news&quot; shows, primarily because by RSS reader is already tuned to the same sources of info so the pod cast becomes redundant.

      <outline text="For the three people following the Weird U.S. saga, there was a scare today, then good news. History Channel rejected the masters we sent because they didn't have VITC, just LTC.

Anyway, it could have been my oversight, my first reaction was that it was the captioning house's lapse, but if it was mine it would have meant hours more work to re-output. It turned out to be captioning, as I thought. And a full evaluation by History Channel brought back a perfect tech review. My reputation is intact, I'm still the guy who knows how.Never mind that I know it was not perfect. But part of my skill in getting things out the door (the prime directive for editors) is knowing what is Good Enough. Entropy fooled again! "/>

      <outline text="So, as I am writing this, I am also updating my wife's computer to MS Office 2003. I have setup her computer and her laptop, so that her My Documents folder and her Outlook Data File and her Contacts are stored on a small portable USB attached hard drive. This way, she can just tote the hard drive, in her purse, between the office and home, and she has all the files she needs, at any given time. This is my low-tech solution, as I know that I could set her up a server and store the stuff in one place. But, that is too much for her, so I try to keep it simple."/>

      <outline text="Many times we have the discussion here about 'personalisation' of the website - a bit like the recent beta offerings from Microsoft and Google. Each time, someone pipes up and says 'MyBBC'!! This was a project a few years back which was doomed to failure. Lots of good ideas about how things should work etc, but it;s just didn't 'work' and people didn't really know what they wanted, as I think they asked too many people, who obviously all had different requirements. Many technologies have moved on since, especially in terms of the browsers and the available plugins etc (Flash!) along with AJAX and some cunning client-side tech."/>

Maybe ask them to help us define what's allowable content modification and what's not. At this point, the EFF hasn't been willing to answer the question, they just evade it, dancing around like a Republican spin doctor (when they're being nice) and telling us &quot;tough shit&quot; when they can't be bothered. If we're going to help them pay their bills, they should pay attention to our interests, maybe even represent them. And let's see if the EFF can respect that someone might have a different opinion than theirs, and engage in a little discourse instead of personal attack. That would be a first step. "/>

      <outline text="David L., that's a difficult question to answer.  I'm a bit more geeky than alot of the more &quot;traditional&quot; Mac users (pre-OS X, that is), perhaps, in that I have a great deal of patience and will put in a alot of time working on something until I can get it to work.  That said, the new breed of Unix-Macheads are probably more like me, though, and probably will welcome any release (and will probably be more willing to go through the existing registration procedure).  I'd say go for the releases; most of the folks interested in using OPML Editor at this point in time are probably more tech-savvy, don't you agree?  You know they're going to be dying to try it!

      <outline text="Installation itself may also be an issue, since I don't currently have a CD/DVD-ROM drive, a floppy drive, or a reliable network connection to install from.  I was able to install OS 9 only after purchasing some cables on eBay, networking the PowerBook to an old Umax (Macintosh clone), and using its CD-ROM drive to install from.  The problem is, the Umax doesn't always want to recognize it's own CD-ROM drive, so I often have to reboot several times before the drive shows up.  That's not even the half of it, for even when it does recognize the drive, there's no guarantee it'll show up on my PowerBook, too.  I'm not certain why this happens; there's clearly a bit of SCSI Voodoo going on here.  I only know that some mystical series of reboots between my PowerBook and the Mac clone sooner or later brings up the OS install disc's icon on my PowerBook, and when it does I jump on the opportunity to run the installer.  During this series of exercises I feel like a circus clown performing his j..."/>

      <outline text="Think your show is great (blah, blah...the usual), anyway, I was thinking about your rating on iTunes - currently 44.  I know you have better listenership than that.  &quot;This Week in Tech&quot; is at number three and Diggnation is at 14, but you guys keep falling.  I think the difference is how your listeners are getting the show.  Leo Laporte - and company - straight out asked all listeners to start getting the show from iTunes, thus boosting their ratings on iTunes.  After such plea was made, the results were almost instant. It pushed TWIT from something like 14 all the way to 3.  So, I think if you make a similar plea and explain your reasoning, the effect should be similar.  Anyway, just a thought.  Keep up the good work, you guys rock - of course, my wife just thinks you guys are grose (though she does laugh along). Michael."/>

      <outline text="We don't get no respect from Google, we don't get no respect from the EFF, but we do get respect, tons of it, from Rupert Murdoch. Now who do you think gets it, the tech industry, or...? Heh. My bet is, I hope, clear. The techies have an inflated sense of self-importance. The information system of the WORLD is changing, Murdoch sees that, and sees himself as an immigrant (all of us who were reared in the centralized information system of the 20th century are), and because of that, understands that he has much to learn. The young minds of the tech industry aren't young enough to be rooted in the transition, or old enough to get that a transition is taking place, and that they are building on a foundation that's eroding. If they were aware, Google would be pushing RSS instead of resisting it, and the EFF would be protecting the integrity of our work, instead of helping Google undermine it. We have a chance for a revolution, it's just a chance, Murdoch gets this, so the barriers are proba..."/>

      <outline text="Last week I wrote about insiders and two-tier communities. That's Silicon Valley. The hubris of financiers thinking they could do it by paying nothing for technology, nothing for ideas. Yeah Hollywood is corrupt, and they want to tie up tech to serve their purposes, but they are still turning out product that some people want. Can you say the same for Silicon Valley? Imho, it's become another gray metropolis, the ideas long gone, replaced by corporate strokers and lap dogs."/>
      <outline text="Joe Beda, a former Microsoft guy, now works at Google, and blogs about it. I find it hard to believe that being at Google is that good, don't fundamental laws of physics and human nature apply there? Otherwise why would they re-invent perfectly good technology just because it was Not Invented Here. Or why would they take chances with the Web as a free speech environment? On the other hand I've met Joe, even went out to dinner with him in Seattle, and enjoyed his company and thought he was an honest dude and a good catch for the Googlers."/>
      <outline text=" I've hunted all over the site looking for a way to map domains to an IP address, and while they will &quot;forward&quot; the doman (not what I want) they won't map it. I then called their tech support line, was told the wait would be two minutes, and hung up after fifteen (and the ads, these guys are always pushing stuff at you)."/>
      <outline text="We're not having a serious discussion about the Google AutoLink feature. Boing Boing points to a sarcastic non-refutation of my piece. If this is the best we can do, we deserve what we get. To the BB people, Google hasn't drawn any kind of line, saying where this can't go. And consider what heat would be generated if what Google is doing to us were done to Google. Can I put up a Web app that scrapes Google and replaces their ads with mine, or adds mine to theirs? Could Microsoft? Could AP or the New York Times? When you take that first step down the slope, take a good look at what's further down the hill, because you're going there for sure. I keep hoping for intelligent discourse in the tech blogging community, it's still pretty rare. And to Yoz, I care, but I'm not obsessed. I think I'm looking out for you, how about helping out? Same with anyone else who publishes on the Web."/>
      <outline text="Thanks to Halley for the kind words about my contribution to podcasting, as well as Adam's. This gives me a chance to say that I've not tried to write Adam out of the story. Quite the opposite, I think his contribution was essential, and not just in the last half-year. Podcasting appears to everyone but a small number of people, to be an instant wonder. But the trail goes back a long way. It took a lot of iteration and patience to make it happen. As I write this a bunch of other future &quot;instant wonders&quot; are in gestation. There will be a time when they will move to the top of the stack and be the engines of growth for the tech industry. Markoff will write stories about them too, explaining how his friends have finally figured out how to make money from them as if it was the responsibility of every technology to make John Doerr even richer. I'd like people to be more open-minded about these ideas, while they need help to get started. In hindsight, podcasting could have happened much soon..."/>

      <outline text="Blogging started in the tech community, and over the years, we've followed stories, sometimes they were picked up by mainstream media, often with little or no credit to the bloggers who did the discovery and research. Then the political bloggers did the same, and got the credit for putting the pressure on the MSM that's been going on in technology reporting for so long. Today we work with our colleagues at eWeek and News.Com, ZDNet, and even some of the reporters for business publications and local newspapers. I have a feeling the story we're working on, with Google pushing the envelope on the story of Smart Tags, is going that way. Let's hope the larger press community tunes in, and let's keep this a class act on both sides. There are some interesting issues, and few clear answers. Let's show everyone what the political blogosphere may look like in a few years."/>
      <outline text="I got an email from Dan Gillmor saying I didn't quote him correctly, and that's certainly possible, but I think I responded to the essence of what he said. There's nothing controversial about eBay or Craig's List, nor surprising, nor unethical. At some point there will be an MP3 of the session so we can check. Further he says that he didn't give a speech, and this is true. I wrote my comment in real time, as his session was starting up. After the fact, it was more of a Q&amp;A with Dan and to a lesser extent, Paul Jones. This would have been uremarkable at a Silicon Valley tech conference, but was unusual for a blogging conference. I also would not have been at the SV tech conference, that model is over as far as I'm concerned. I don't believe in fountains of wisdom, I think there's more smarts in what we used to think of as an &quot;audience&quot; than there ever is at the front of the room. Funny thing is, I thought Dan believed that too."/>

Who cares if they're friends with Flickr, Delicious, Typepad, etc. What does it mean for two products to be friends anyway? What happened to open protocols and level playing fields? Sometimes I think these people don't understand the Internet. Wouldn't it be refreshing if Technorati said &quot;Here's how we work with products we hate.&quot; Wouldn't that be reassuring? Don't you wonder sometimes about the backroom deals? Don't tech companies have to work at preserving their integrity and credibility?

      <outline text="Politics spoiled identity, and would have spoiled RSS had the major players not converged on RSS 2.0. The difference this time was that there was a Switzerland, me, to guide RSS through its gauntlet, and I clearly wasn't in bed with any of the major publishers or vendors.

      <outline text="This question comes up from time to time, and I've resisted answering it directly, thinking that anyone who really read the spec would come to the conclusion that RSS allows zero or one enclosures per item, and no more. The same is true for all other sub-elements of item, except category, where multiple elements are explicitly allowed. The spec refers to &quot;the enclosure&quot; in the singular. Regardless, some people persist in thinking that you may have more than one enclosure per item. "/>
      <outline text="Sometime in the last few days Yahoo announced that they were working on a new RSS 2.0 namespace that relates, somehow, to their (new?) media search capability. There's a spec and a mail list. I received no advance notice of the work, although it appears that others did. There were some substantial errors in the initial draft that will be corrected soon, according to posts from Yahoo people on the mail list. It's good that they're doing their work in a namespace, as mandated by the RSS 2.0 roadmap. I'm not sure of the purpose, but am watching the mail list. Is it a good idea? No one knows. It doesn't look like the advance from podcasting that they claim it is, but it's really hard to tell. "/>
      <outline text="Sorry I missed this excellent February 12 rant that explains why users don't like being held hostage by tech companies. Read the whole thing. It's eloquent, angry and concise. I think what's changing, slowly, is that the tools now exist for users to express themselves, and they're starting to do that, about us, about how they don't like our attempts to control them. "/>
      <outline text="I've gotten lots of email on the trusting Google story below, and I'll write more about it in the coming days, I'm sure. Trust and software companies is a big deal, if the companies understood before trust became their major issue they probably would have done things differently. Microsoft, the dominant tech company in Seattle, where I now live (at least for the next few days), deals with this. They would be much further along, imho, had they not been so incredibly aggressive with their competitors, catching small developers and their users in the crossfire. When it came time to promote Passport as a universal identity system for the Internet, there was no trust left, and it flopped. Too bad, because at that time we desperately needed a universal identity system. They needed one too. "/>
      <outline text="More mature industries understand this much better than the tech industry. Remember how Johnson &amp; Johnson withdrew Tylenol from the market when their product was being sabotaged. In the end their recall probably didn't save any lives, but there's little doubt that because of the scare, the product would have died. By quickly taking it off the shelves, visibly showing concern for their users, at a huge cost to the company, they earned our trust, and the brand came back big. You never see tech companies with that kind of vision, that kind of understanding of their relationship to the user, or to be plain, that kind of caring for people.  "/>
      <outline text="Okay, first a disclaimer, Google very generously supported my last conference, and they've said privately that they will undo the evil stuff they did in the past, but they haven't done it yet, and they didn't buy my silence, nor should they want to. But Google took some cheap shots at a technology that wasn't doing them any harm, for no apparent reason other than arrogance. This is exactly the kind of stuff you want to watch out for, from high tech giants we want to trust. "/>

      <outline text="For example, &quot;What is the podcast about?&quot; can be handled by the description element, that's actually been in RSS since 0.91. What keywords could be associated? That's the category element. When was the podcast recorded? That could be pubDate (but maybe he wants them to be separate dates, in which case we'd have to go to a namespace, not a problem). What are categories? Hmmm, maybe I misuderstood keywords. What's the diff betw categories and keywords? Isn't keyword just a simple case of category? (Please don't yell at me.)"/>
      <outline text="The only two that clearly require new elements are: &quot;Who is on the podcast?&quot; (There can only be one author element per item, but podcasts can and often do have more than one.)

      <outline text="Draft: How to extend RSS 2.0. This is a new howto I wrote this morning while packing to fly to NYC. It's just a draft. Talking with Adam over the weekend, I said &quot;Hey, if you can fly an airplane, you can learn to extend RSS.&quot; He laughed, probably wondering when I was going to call him on the dumb blonde act. Anyway, namespaces seem so difficult because there's almost nothing to it. Like the Web, they're loosely coupled. Most of the glue is there to help human beings, the software assumes you know what you're doing, and ignores stuff it doesn't understand. Even though the core is frozen, RSS itself is a liberal environment, you don't need anyone's permission to extend it. It's really simple, as the name suggests. "/>

      <outline text="With all due respect to Jeffrey Veen, who I know from my Wired days, his experience with the email model type of RSS reader is exactly why that's the model you don't want to use. It's not like email. Let the river of items flow through your queue, scroll over them with a scroll bar, and don't let the software tell you you're falling behind. Your time is what's valuable, there's no value to the items you didn't read. If it's important it'll pop up again. RSS is not email. Don't sort them out into little boxes that you have to go to, make them flow to you, in a river, unsorted. I wish people would just listen to this simple idea, so many people are using RSS the wrong way."/>
      <outline text="Tim Bray suggests that Atom might nearly be finished. I read his comments carefully, and find the benefits of the possibly-final Atom to be vague, and the premise absolutely incorrect. Unlike SGML, RSS has been widely deployed, successfully, by users of all levels of technical expertise. There are many thousands of popular RSS feeds updating every day, from technology companies like Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo, Sun and Oracle, big publishing companies like Reuters, The Wall Street Journal, NY Times, Newsweek, Time, BBC, Guardian, etc, exactly the kinds of enterprises that his employer serves. It's also widely used by today's opinion leaders, the bloggers. Where SGML was beached and floundering, RSS is thriving and growing. So to conclude that RSS needs the same help that SGML did, is simply not supported by facts."/>

He's a brilliant guy, I've brainstormed many technical projects with him between 2000 and 2002 or so, when we lost touch. Alex was a tech exec at Netscape at the time they were doing RSS, one of the unsung heroes, IMHO. We talked about podcasting, and tried to figure out, aside from the world being ready for it now, what's new about it, and I said it's XML, which allows a variety of processors acting as user agents. This had come up in the meeting at Microsoft earlier this week, I was singing the praises of RSS, and the lights didn't come on until they realized how much of the work of RSS was done on the client. It looks deceptively simple from the server or content p.o.v. until you realize that the client can run software, and not just a browser.

      <outline text="A perennial problem with RSS is how does the publisher force an unsubscribe? Shouldn't the publisher have the right to opt-out? Right now there is no mechanism that's broadly supported by aggregators. This has come up many times but always gets mired in the usual hand-wringing and second-guessing of the XML mail lists. If you were looking for a use-case, consider the NY Times Olympics feed. Here's a screen shot of their latest entry. Now the Times presumably can configure their server in a couple of weeks to tell aggregators that the resource is gone. Even so, many aggregators won't notice and will keep polling indefinitely. And many content people can't change their server in this way. I'm no longer on the RSS advisory board, so I won't be playing a role in solving the problem, but it needs to be solved. "/>

This is a company that I've written about, a mixture of positive and negative; but I think always realistic. I didn't get an invite to the briefing. Now, this is the way tech companies controlled the tech press, and created the need for tech blogs (like this one). I'm not going to change. You won't see air-brushed pictures of what I see, for better or worse. But it's sad when companies that really need help (remember, this is a second-tier search provider) only choose cheerleaders to roll out their offerings through. "/>

While this is the first time I've published an aggregated site, it's not an original idea. Jim Moore has been talking about this for a long time, and Taegan Goddard at Political Wire has been doing it. The cool thing about curatorship in RSS now is that there's critical mass. There are enough different feeds, different points of view, that it's possible to be artistic. BTW, the weather in Boston is going to be pretty good. This time of year it can be brutally hot.

Oddpost turned the idea of what you could do with a browser upside down, by producing a clone of Microsoft Outlook in JavaScript and DHTML running in MSIE.

      <outline text="Yesterday, I got a note about a great BitTorrent-with-RSS application. I saw the URL to the feed, and groaned. It's RDF. Now, all the BT+RSS apps have been built around RSS 2.0 because it has the enclosure element, and we'd never, as far as I know, anticipated that the RSS confusion would creep into this space. I looked at the file to see how they did it, and whoa, it's a 2.0 file, even though on the outside it says it's RDF. Once you combine RSS with other things, which definitely should be happening more, you add another dimension with the two other flavors. Instead of having to do something once, you have to do it three times. And that's more than three times the trouble, which makes it less than one-third as likely to happen. Imagine going to the BitTorrent people with that problem. &quot;Call us back when you make your mind up,&quot; they might reasonably say."/>

      <outline text="An announcement. After giving it much thought, I've decided to resign from the RSS Advisory Board, effective July 1. I feel that the process for clarifying the spec is now well-understood by the existing members, and we have started a positive working relationship with several leading aggregator developers. Frankly, most of the time I was spending on the board has been in avoiding and dealing with flamers, which as others have noted is not a good use of my time. Now that I'm leaving Harvard, I want to spend much of my technical work time on the open source release of the Frontier kernel and other forward-looking projects. I want to be out of the business of avoiding flames, if possible. I wish the continuing members of the board the very best, and of course I will continue to be a huge booster of RSS and syndication technology, and I will offer my opinion, through this blog, naturally, as always. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;"/>

      <outline text="Another pet peeve is a low-level programming issue. There's no need to say isPermaLink=&quot;true&quot; on the guid element in RSS 2.0 because true is its default value. In a typical feed this wastes about 2.2 percent of the bandwidth used by the feed. "/>

If your aggregator can export an OPML list of the feeds you're subscribed to (most can) then become a member of the feeds site, and either upload your OPML, or enter a URL where the OPML can be read. 23 people are participating at the beginning of the day; I'd like to see 100 people by the end. I'm going to write some more code today and fix bugs, as they come up. So far we've tested it with quite a few aggregators, esp NetNewsWire and BlogLines, but I'm sure there are more interesting ways to export OPML that we've yet to discover. I'm going to publish the souce for the parser so there are no mysteries, using a very liberal open source license. If you have trouble, if you can provide the full OPML that would be great.

      <outline text="Scoble is right, if people were paying attention, they'd be concerned at how IBM and Google are throwing their weight around in syndication space. And if Microsoft were doing what they're doing, there would be a holy jihad. Technology companies have always acted this way, and I guess they always will. I remember well how IBM screwed up SOAP, and the pattern is totally repeating. The same thing will happen with RSS, unless users, content publishers and independent developers take an interest. RSS is definitely good enough and growing at a huge rate. There's still hope that the proponents of Atom will see the wisdom of not forking and building compatibly off the RSS base. And there's hope that users will act in their own interest. "/>
      <outline text="The RSS 2.0 spec and its predecessors may not say clearly enough if you can or can't include markup in titles. But I don't think you should include markup in titles. Titles are like file names (not exactly of course). They are a happy medium between software and people. Both must be able to read them and make sense of them, in all contexts, and do so easily. While it seems reasonable that a description may contain markup, it also seems reasonable that a title should not. So, if I were writing a validator for RSS, and encountered markup in a title, I'd warn the author that many processors would not be happy about this and it would be safer to strip the markup from the title. "/>
      <outline text="A postscript. I went back to see what the spec actually says, and it turns out it's not really a problem with the spec, rather with my recollection of what the spec says. Scroll to elements of item. It says descriptions may contain entity-encoded HTML. It doesn't say that a title may. So if that's the biggest problem people can find with the spec (which many were flaming about when I wrote it, it's not like they offered any help, btw) then it's a pretty damned good spec if you ask me."/>

A small cost, a used-up name, a very small cost, but with the gain that we could add new functionality. A W3C working group had the idea of a well-known location in work on the Platform For Privacy, and created a hypothetical folder called w3c and put a site's privacy settings there. That's a good idea. I could then start a folder called Berkman, and applications that originated at Berkman would store their data in that folder.

      <outline text="1. On Tuesday, July 15, UserLand Software transferred its copyright in the RSS 2.0 spec to Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard Law School. This addresses one of the major concerns about RSS 2.0, that it was published by one of the competitors in the RSS application space. That no longer is true."/>
      <outline text="2. The spec is licensed under terms that allow it to be customized, excerpted and republished, using the Creative Commons Attribution/Share Alike license. So Berkman is basically acting as a distributor for the technology. We hope that this will inspire new profiles that extend RSS so it can meet the needs of diverse applications. "/>
      <outline text="4. An independent advisory board has been formed to promote the wider use of RSS, to maintain the spec according to the roadmap, and to remove one of the major objections, that only UserLand could answer questions about RSS. The three-member board votes, the majority rules. The three board members are Brent Simmons, Jon Udell and Dave Winer."/>
      <outline text="5. The first task for the advisory board is to carefully review the RSS 2.0 specification in its new context. Quite a few documents moved, there probably are broken links. Help from the community is requested."/>

      <outline text="On July 1, Derek Scruggs requested something related to the harmonizer that I had already done, last year, the Web Bug Simulator. As you might imagine, it simulates those cute little web bugs, one-pixel graphics that help tally hits and referers. In RSS there is no such thing as a web bug. that's why we have to simulate them. By default all Radio users participate. And it accumulates a page of stats. Very useful. Very unknown. Maybe not any more. Yesterday I had a long talk with Jon Udell, lamenting that so many problems have been solved that so few people know about, and we spend all this energy arguing about changing things that honestly really can't be changed. How much better it would be if we had a business development, tech writing, tech support and marketing function for all this open development we do. Then it could make the world a better place instead of an angrier place. That wasn't idle talk, btw, we're seriously considering how to do it."/>

      <outline text="The power of the software developer not to develop is largely silent, so people don't consider it. Sure the original author may toil at a money-losing labor-of-love long past the point where it has been proven not to be viable, but what about the people he or she is not hiring, the manual writers, testers, more programmers, a sales person, a marketing person perhaps, to work on ease of use and to keep the website current. How about a couple of tech support people (so they can take a vacation once in a while, it's a tough job). It goes without saying, I hope, that these people don't work for free. So if you don't want to pay, you can't have any of it. "/>

      <outline text="OK, here's the news I was teasing about earlier. As you may know, Jon Udell took a job at InfoWorld, as a columnist with an agent provacateur sideline. His mission: to get the content of InfoWorld to start to flow out through weblogs. This was deliberate, I am told, by Steve Gillmor, who hired Jon. Most InfoWorlders don't know much about weblogs, but the management is curious, probably a bit more than curious. So today, they will take a step down a path that (I think) will eventually turn InfoWorld into a fully-weblog-enabled publication, with their first blog, authored by Jon Udell, of course. Now to a Scripting News reader this is hardly earth-shaking. It means that Jon's url changed. BFD, right? But now the InfoWorld readers (and reporters, columnists, editors, sales people and management) are going to be reading and hearing about weblogs from one of the best in the techblogger community. What's next? More InfoWorld weblogs, of course! After that, I'll take Pat McGovern to lunch and..."/>
      <outline text="On this day in 1999, the NY Times ran its first piece on weblogs. Some have claimed that weblogs didn't get started until late 1999, a few months after Blogger was first deployed. This is contradicted by the Times article and an earlier one by Scott Rosenberg at Salon, in May 1999. Both pieces reported on a weblog world that was already established and growing. The first note of Blogger on Scripting News was 8/23/99. It's possible that was not its release date, but I think it was close. BTW, it's really cool that the Times and Salon both keep archives back that far. Most pubs don't."/>

All these court cases are as stupid as dirt. Several good technical preventatives exist. First, if the search engine supports robots.txt, you can simply edit the file on your site, and save the lawyer's fees. If it doesn't support robots.txt, first raise the issue in public, and the tech weblogs will get right on it. If that doesn't work, add a simple script to your server to look at the referer attribute on the HTTP request and if it isn't from your site, redirect to your deep linking policy page. We know for sure that when a company goes to court for &quot;deep linking&quot; that they aren't talking to, or listening to, their technical people. BTW, deep linking is an oxymoron.

Yes of course they all are. Led me to an interesting place. In some areas we have deep respect for the techies. I saw that at the hospital. It's deserved resepect.

      <outline text="So this leads me to the next question -- does my software ever save anyone's life? Is there enough value in it so that I could earn the kind of money the doctors earn (they have to be making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year). I'm pretty sure that to be a top software developer requires as much training, perseverence, rocket science -- as being a top surgeon; but our society doesn't value us equally. When medical legislation comes up in Washington, for example, it's not uncommon for doctors to testify -- but when legislation or court decisions affecting technology comes up, no developers are asked to explain the technology. You get CEOs of tech companies, but that's a far cry from a practicing software developer."/>
      <outline text="I tried to have an intelligent discussion about this with the Times reporter last year after the piece ran. I asked this question. Suppose a reporter goes to a baseball game, and due to some fluke, his presence alters the outcome of the game, and Team A wins. If the reporter hadn't been there, Team B would have won. Assume there's no question about this. So which outcome should the reporter report? Which team won? Of course there's no question. So why should it be any different for tech coverage? The presence of a Times reporter may have altered the outcome of the SOAP interop work. We don't know for sure. But the outcome was different from what he reported. As a result we have some meaningful interop and it doesn't revolve around MS. Look at the Google API experience. Bing."/>
      <outline text="Another note. Ken Layne's comment really stings. &quot;There's nothing novel about the tech bloggers, beyond the fact that a few of them made simple tools for updating Web sites.&quot; It's very hard work to make things simple, especially when lots of people want to do it. And there's more to personal publishing on the Web than reverse-chronologic posting. Further, the tech blogs are not limited to discussion of technology itself; we're people -- just like you. When Sept 11 happened, we were all affected. And if we work together, with respect, you may find that technology is even more relevant now that tens of thousands of people are writing publicly on the Web. "/>

I would prefer if the pros did their job, and dug in, and reported the news, so I could focus on doing what I really like to do, writing software.

I sincerely hope that SOAP vs XML-RPC does not become another My Platform Is Better arena that's so common in tech culture. Both protocols are fine. There is extra stuff in SOAP that's not present in XML-RPC. But the details are hidden in most scripting platforms, so the extra stuff isn't in anyone's way. Interop was in question, but a lot of the concerns were laid to rest with Google's interop. Now any reasonable person, no matter what their protocol preference, should be able to move on from here.

A few days before Morpheus shut down last month I downloaded the software and installed it. I had a specific mission in mind. My MP3 collection had almost no Elvis Costello, and, having heard an NPR interview with him, I was interested. So I booted up Morpheus and went looking and found lots of hits, mostly the songs I already had, and downloaded a couple I hadn't, and the quality was so low, I threw them in the trash. My time is worth money and of course I would have happily downloaded a curated and quality-assured package of Elvis songs, with written narrative (he's an interesting guy, very smart, a good story teller) for $39.

Looking at it from this perspective, it's ridiculous that the tech industry is in a downturn while Moore's Law is still inexorably putting so much power on our desktops and in our servers, and we now have a networking infrastructure that few would have dreamed of ten years ago. That we're in a contraction is evidence, imho, that we've played our hand badly."/>

      <outline text="During Bill Joy's little on-stage advertisement he took a bunch of cheap shots and I couldn't help myself from saying to my fellow audience members &quot;what an asshole.&quot; (This morning Scripting News is a cesspole too.) He still thinks SOAP is a Microsoft-only thing. I wonder if anyone believed him. I hope not. Later, in the Web Services session audience members asked where the low-hanging fruit is (someone had mentioned that there was lots) and none of the panelists had an answer. I wanted to get up and do the agent provacateur thing which I have sworn off. Had I done so I would have said PUB-SUB. Low-tech. Much needed. A pleasure button. Someone asked each panelist to point to an example of a web service today. Only Lucas Gonze had an answer. I was sitting behind Tony Hong of XMethods. He's got a few. I would have pointed them to Manila, which is a fully scriptable Web application. Tim was talking about Web Services in exactly the same way we talked about scriptable apps in the Mac in th..."/>

      <outline text="We're going to try to come up with a big enough story and expose the whole thing. So it might not be just a small cadre of journalists that squeak about the big boys, we might see a turn to the truth in coverage of technology. I'm optimistic about this for the first time in a long time. It's a good time for the tech industry to take this hit. As we rebuild let's do it on a solid foundation, let's encourage the journalists to really understand what we do, and have the courage to answer the tough questions. "/>

      <outline text="This afternoon I'm flying to Seattle to participate in an all-day design preview at Microsoft for P2P technology. These meetings of high-tech CTOs are like mini-Davoses, Microsoft always gets interesting groups of people together, and the offline talks are every bit as interesting as the on-stage talks. The meeting itself is on background, so I won't be able to talk about what takes place there, without permission from Microsoft. "/>

But another, more frightening reason for the lack of buybacks could be that many tech companies simply don't believe that their already beaten-down shares are a bargain -- they see room for more downside.&quot;"/>

      <outline text="On NPR last night a commentator said that what was new in this year's election return experience is that there was actual news. Are professional news people prepared for this? There are lessons here for the tech press, whose appreciation and understanding of technology is just as weak as that of the political reporters. It's inescapable, technology is part of every story from now on. Do we question what the technologists tell us? It's time to stop believing everything everyone with a propeller on his hat says. In other words, Murphy is running everything now. Just because the computers didn't melt down on Jan 1, doesn't mean we're home-free. There's a technology angle to every story."/>

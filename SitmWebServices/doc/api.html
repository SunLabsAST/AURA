<h1>Overview</h1>

<h2> General </h2>
The API loosely follows REST style conventions For some of the
methods, you will need to use an application key.  You can obtain
an application key by registering here: [[ url tbd ]].  Use UTF-8
encoding when sending arguments to API methods. See the [[terms-of-service
(tbd)]] for information about what we consider to be acceptable
use.

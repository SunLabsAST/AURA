<h1>Overview</h1>

The API loosely follows REST style conventions

<h2> Encoding </h2>
Use UTF-8 encoding when sending arguments to API methods.

<h2> General </h2>

<h2> Authentication </h2>
 The authentication protocol allows you to perform actions on user
 accounts in a manner that is secure for Last.fm users. All write services
 require authentication.

 Generally speaking, you will send a method parameter expressed as
 'package.method' along with method specific arguments to the root URL. The API
 supports multiple transport formats but will respond in Last.fm idiom xml by
 default.

 Note:

     * Please use an identifiable User-Agent header on all requests. Like this you
     * don't risk getting banned and it helps our logging.
         * Use common sense when deciding how many calls to make. For example, if
         * you're making a web application, try not to hit the API on page load.
         * You account may be suspended if your application is continuously making
         * several calls per second. See our terms of service for more.
